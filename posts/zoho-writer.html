<h1>Zoho Writer</h1>
            Very very cool online wordprocessing tool. You can import word and open office files in. But again, like the point I made in my OpenOffice post, the coolest clincher I see in this app is the export-to-pdf feature. I tested this out and it is brilliant. Amazing.

You need to see this for yourself. Click here (zoho.com).

 For some weird reason - Zoho reached out to me to remove the link - apparently the back links are hurting their Google rankings (or some such reason). The respect that I had for them has decreased substantially with this. Why would a company get in touch with a blogger who has written well about you.
