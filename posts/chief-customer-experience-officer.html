 on a very pleasant customer experience with Bigbasket. I strongly feel that, any company which is interacting with customers on a regular basis, should have a Chief Customer Experience Officer.

Penning down some thoughts on the same below.
 <ul>
  <li>
   I did think for a little while, that this should be a major responsibility of the product leader, but on hind-sight, I do not think so. It is a large responsibility on the product leader to think about the customer and evolve the products/services of the company towards that, but there is much more that the product leader does.
  </li>
  <li>
   I strongly believe that, a role focussed solely on the customer is much more beneficial than, it being part of the role, of another executive. It demands and deserves a separate role.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CCXO (sure, it is a four letter acronym, and overlaps the generic CXO, but this is purely hypothetical) should have far ranging powers that span cross-functional domains.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CCXO should be comfortable with tech, marketing, business, field, operations, and most importantly with the consumer landscape.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CCXO should be the person who knows the most about consumer environment, pain points, and behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
   The out reach of the CCXO evolves over time, because the environment, pain points, and behavior evolve over time.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CCXO should have be the voice of the customer and be emboldened enough to argue against any/every other function in the company and fight for them.
  </li>
  <li>
   The CCXO and Product Head should work very closely in planning out current features and future roadmap.
  </li>
  <li>
   CCXO should have his/her own data sets and inferring mechanisms to make sense of the customer base, and impacts being made.
  </li>
  <li>
   CCXO should also work closely with customer support and ensure delight and redressal happens without fuss. Processes and exception mechanisms, and empowerment of the team are important here.
  </li>
  <li>
   End of the day, the CCXO is charged with creating beautiful customer experiences that are worth remembering.
  </li>
 </ul>
