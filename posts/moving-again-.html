Yes, I am moving again. No, not physically. The blog is moving. I first had my blog for a few years on blogspot. At that time, it was a pretty rudimentary service, and then I found wordpress.com to be far superior at that time.

Now, I am making a bigger leap. I have my own domain, and my own host.

 Update:
</strong>
Just realized. I have had this blog on wordpress.com for about 5 years. Thanks wordpress for powering this blog for so long, with just unfailing quality. I am continuing with wordpress.org software on my domain.
