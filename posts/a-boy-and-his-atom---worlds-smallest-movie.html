<h1>A Boy And His Atom - World's smallest movie</h1>
            Well, the first time you are reading the title, you are probably thinking (like I did), that this is going to be another animated short, but maybe this is really really short. Well no. It is the world in which the movie is shot that is small. This movie has been created by IBM by  moving actual atoms and molecules on a surface. Well, there are two reactions that are pummelling with each other in my mind -- "IBM is the only place which can produce such an amazingly cool thing." vs. "Engineering folks at IBM have a lot of time in their hands". :)

For engineers like me, the cooler video is the next video - "the making of the movie". Mind blowing.
