            <h1>GTD ! using Yahoo !</h1>
            Chris Wright explains in his blog an cheap, simple, and elegant way for Yahoo ! users to leverage on the suite of tools that Yahoo ! provides to implement GTD. Defenitely a good read. There are two parts to it. Not sure if there is more coming, but it is no doubt a fairly comprehensive document (with screenshots). He goes by David Allen for most of the time - but for some exceptions like 'keeping the tickler file digital'. He says it is because of his liking to move away from paper.
