            <h1>Criticism and Praise</h1>
            Scott H Young in his blog has an excellent post on Criticism and Praise. He notes that, both are the same. One should not let either get under your skin.
<blockquote>
 If you do anything unique, people will attack you for it. Self-motivation depends on having a thick skin, persisting in spite of criticism. But equally important is the ability to not let praise consume you, either. Because, praise and criticism are just reflections of each other.
</blockquote>
He ends the post by saying:
<blockquote>
 The ideal state of mind is humble confidence. You are humble, because you accept all feedback, searching for actionable suggestions, open to any opportunity. You are confident because you wonâ€™t allow emotional praise or criticism to distract you from your goals.
</blockquote>
I am reminded of the famous verse from the Bhagavath Gita :
<blockquote>
 <em>
  Karmanyeva adhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana
Ma karmaphalahetur bhurma te sangostvakarmani.
 </em>
 <em>
 </em>
 "Thy business is with the action only, never with its   fruits; so let not the fruits of action be thy motive, nor be thou to inaction   attached." Gita: Chapter II-47.
</blockquote>
In other words, do the action, without thinking about the fruits of it. This is exactly the outcome if you proactively practise what Scott says in this post.
