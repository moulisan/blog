I usually do not forward or propagate 'forward-emails' - emails which say that, this happened to my friends brothers sister-in-law. But this one brought with it major entertainment. This is about a little girl who went for a UKG interview in one of the premeire schools in Chennai. The Principal asks the girl to tell a story, to which the kid asks if she can narrate a story that she has written, or a story that she has just read. The surprised Principal asks her to read the story that she had written. If this is really true, God bless the kid - she is going to go places.

  Ok, tell me story which you have written.

Sarithra said "Ravanan kidnapped Sita to Srilanka"

Opening scene failed to impress the Principal but still she encouraged the child to continue.

"Rama asked Hanuman's help to rescue Sita. Hanuman too agreed to help Rama "

"Then?"

"Now, Hanuman called his friend Spider man." No one expected this twist in the story

"Why?"

"Because there are lot of mountains between India and Srilanka..if we have Spiderman we can go easily with his rope."

"But Hanuman can fly isn't it??"
 </div>
 <div>
 </div>
 <div>
  "Yes. But he is having Sanjeevi Mountain on one hand, so he cannot fly very fast. "
 </div>
 <div>
  "Hanuman and Spiderman flew to Srilanka and rescued Sita. Sita said Thanks to both"

"Why?"

"When you are helped you should say Thanks"

"Hanuman now called Hulk."

All were surprised. She realized our curiosity and said " Now Sita is there, so to take her safely back to Rama..he called Hulk"

"What logic???" the Principal asked.

"Hanuman can carry Sita right?"

"Yes. But he has Sanjeevi Mountain in one hand and has to hold spider man on the other"

The Principal could not control her smiles. " So when they all started to India they met my friend Akshay"

"How come Akshay there now?"

"Because it is my story and I can bring any one there"

Now the Principal didn't get angry but waited for the next twist

Then all started to India and landed at Chennai's Velechery bus stop

Now I asked,"Why they have landed In Velechery bus stop? "

"Because they forgot the way..&amp; Hulk got an idea and called Dora"

"Dora came and she took Sita to Velechery Venus Colony...that's all."
 </div>
 <div>
 </div>
 <div>
  Finished the story with a smile

Now the Principal asked "Why Venus Colony?"

"Because sita is there &amp; I am Sita!!!"
