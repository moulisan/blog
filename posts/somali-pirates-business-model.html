I read this on the UNDispatch.cm (went there through daringfireball). And I thought this is worth a "retweet" on my blog. Wow. This is amazing. I have always heard/read that, people are not driven to piracy (I do not mean software or media piracy here - I mean the piracy of  Somalian and the Carribean kind) because of the lucrativeness behind it (and not driven to it). Is it lucrative or what? Judge for yourself.
<blockquote>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  A basic piracy operation requires a minimum eight to twelve militia prepared to stay at sea for extended periods of time, in the hopes of hijacking a passing vessel. Each team requires a minimum of two attack skiffs, weapons, equipment, provisions, fuel and preferably a supply boat. The costs of the operation are usually borne by investors, some of whom may also be pirates.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  To be eligible for employment as a pirate, a volunteer should already possess a firearm for use in the operation. For this ‘contribution’, he receives a ‘class A’ share of any profit. Pirates who provide a skiff or a heavier firearm, like an RPG or a general purpose machine gun, may be entitled to an additional A-share. The first pirate to board a vessel may also be entitled to an extra A-share.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  At least 12 other volunteers are recruited as militiamen to provide protection on land of a ship is hijacked, In addition, each member of the pirate team may bring a partner or relative to be part of this land-based force. Militiamen must possess their own weapon, and receive a ‘class B’ share — usually a fixed amount equivalent to approximately US$15,000.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  If a ship is successfully hijacked and brought to anchor, the pirates and the militiamen require food, drink, qaad, fresh clothes, cell phones, air time, etc. The captured crew must also be cared for. In most cases, these services are provided by one or more suppliers, who advance the costs in anticipation of reimbursement, with a significant margin of profit, when ransom is eventually paid.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  When ransom is received, fixed costs are the first to be paid out. These are typically:
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  • Reimbursement of supplier(s)
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  • Financier(s) and/or investor(s): 30% of the ransom
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  • Local elders: 5 to 10 %of the ransom (anchoring rights)
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  • Class B shares (approx. $15,000 each): militiamen, interpreters etc.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  The remaining sum — the profit — is divided between class-A shareholders.
 </span>
 <span style="color:#993300;">
  Wonder if they teach that at
