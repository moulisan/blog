<h1>Salad at Namdhari's</h1>
            Had a veg salad at Namdhari's for dinner yesterday, and was I surprised or what. The quantity is large, and the quality of the vegetables are good. Lots of sprouts, bean sprouts, corn, spinach, cabbage, carrots. I tried two of the dressings - coriander and mint, and mayo and garlic. Did not use too much of the dressing, for that would contrast the purpose of the salad.  The salad is served with a piece of soft bread - which is also very good.

On the whole, a very fulfiling meal. I did not think, a salad could fill me up, but the quantity here is such that, I left with just-about-a-full-stomach -- which is by far the best feeling one can get after dinner (not stuffed, nor empty).
