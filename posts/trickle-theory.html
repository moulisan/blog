            Very nice post at RandsInRepose. He talks about how, when one is faced with an 'impossible' task, we should just start doing it. Planning too much increases your worry. He talks about the 'critic' inside each person, and how usually it is one's friend. But in this case, the critic is the one, which scares you more.
<blockquote>
 My advice is: START.

"But Rands... I've got three hundred tests to run and one day to..."

Stop. Go run one test. Now.

"Wait, wait, wait. Rands. Listen. They need this spec tomorrow @ 9am...."

Shush. Quiet. Go write. Just a paragraph. Now.

Welcome to Trickle Theory.
