<h1>Of Rectangles and Rounded Corners</h1>
<blockquote>
 "Today's verdict should not be viewed as a win for Apple, but as a loss for the American consumer," the South Korean electronics firm said after news of the $1 billion patent infringement award by a California jury.

"It will lead to fewer choices, less innovation, and potentially higher prices. It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies."
</blockquote>
Statement from Samsung after Apple won the Patent case in a jury in California. I love the statement about rectangles and rounded corners. So true. I firmly believe, Apple played on the sentimental value of the jurors and the people by playing the "Made in America" card. I cannot believe how silly some of the patent charges are.
