<h1>Tab Order in LinkedIn Post Commenting</h1>
            I just commented on a post on LinkedIn. I found a minor UI nit. This kind of bugged me and in fact, made me lose data once. Let me elaborate.

When I want to comment on a post, I click inside the comment box and start typing. So far so good, and it looks like below.

Now when you are done typing up the post, if you are a heavy keyboard user like me, on seeing the above order of the buttons, I would tab twice. You would expect one tab to get to the Cancel button and another to get to the Comment button.

But nope, that does not happen.

LinkedIn engineers, in the pursuit of productivity, I guess, have reversed the order. First tab goes to the Comment button and the second tab goes to the Cancel button.

And if you are a heavy (and impatient) keyboard user like me, you would have done a double tab and hit enter too. What does this do? Cancel all that you have typed and clears the comment slate. Woah! Yes, and thats how I lost my text comment. I had to type it all over again.

LinkedIn --- please fix this !!
