<h1>Zoho project</h1>
            Wow. Just saw the zoho project tour ppt. Looks awesome. I think they have the right tag line - the social way to get projects done. Some of the cool things that I saw were:
<ul>
<li>
  Integrated chat functionality - which is archived. Small decisions can be taken right there right then.
 </li>
<li>
  Import Microsoft MPP
 </li>
<li>
  Neat Gantt charts
 </li>
<li>
  Dashboard showing the nearby milestones
 </li>
<li>
  Dedicated wiki which is accessible from the dashboard.
 </li>
</ul>
I think it is pretty cool. Should check out.

 For some weird reason - Zoho reached out to me to remove the link - apparently the back links are hurting their Google rankings (or some such reason). The respect that I had for them has decreased substantially with this. Why would a company get in touch with a blogger who has written well about you.
