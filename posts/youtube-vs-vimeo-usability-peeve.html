            <h1>Youtube vs Vimeo [Usability Peeve]</h1>
            There is one big usability peeve I have about launching and watching embedded videos. My typical embedded viewing experience is as below:
<ol>
 <li>
  Read the article on
  <a href="http://www.theoldreader.com">
   theoldreader.com
  </a>
  (yes, I moved from greader -&gt; feedly -&gt; theoldreader - more on that in a different post).
 </li>
 <li>
  If I see a good video that I want to see, I typically click on the "youtube" icon or "vimeo" icon on the post, so that it opens up the video in youtube or vimeo respectively in a new tab.
 </li>
</ol>
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vimeo.jpg">
 <img alt="vimeo" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2905" height="207" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/vimeo-300x207.jpg" width="300"/>

<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/youtube.jpg">
 <img alt="youtube" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2906" height="203" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/youtube-300x203.jpg" width="300"/>
</a>
Now, when I do that, my reasonably average cognitive capabilities want me to think that the video link would open up in a new tab, and should wait for me to go to that tab and press play. Why? Because I had never pressed play on the embedded video. I had just said - open it for me in youtube or vimeo.
<ul>
 <li>
  Youtube opens the video up in a new tab and begins playing it ! Whaa ??? I dont want to watch it now. I will watch it later.
 </li>
 <li>
  Vimeo dutifully follows my thought process, opens up the video in a new tab and waits for me to go and press the play button.
 </li>
</ul>
<strong>
 In this duel, Vimeo wins. Sorry youtube.
</strong>
PS: By the way, you should watch the planet six video. Hilariously done. Simple claymation with a message.
