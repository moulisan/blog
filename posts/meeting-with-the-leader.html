            <h1>Meeting with the leader</h1>
            Jason, from blackbeltproductivity, has covered an often neglected topic, in a short and sweet post. He covers what you should do, before you have a 1-1 with your leader. It is incredibly important, you prepare for a 1-1. I have very recently noticed this. I actually write down bullets that I want to cover with my boss, before my 1-1. This defenitely helps. One, the boss feels good that, the 1-1 is productive. The second, sometimes the 1-1s just finish faster. Often times, before I have noticed that I waste a lot of time in the 1-1 itself trying to remember something that I wanted to talk about.
