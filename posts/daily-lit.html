 Ok. You are the types, who does not get enough time to read books, but you are forever on email. (Well, I have to admit that I am of that type too). Rejoice people.
</p>
<p>
 Daily Lit has a beautiful collection of books, which they have nicely split up into small chunks (or parts as they call it). You give your email address and a frequency of time, and they will email you a book part by part, so that you can read a Dickens classic in about 2 years.
</p>
<p>
 Well, not really, if you have some time (or if you are in one of those suspense chapters of a book), you can request the next part to be emailed immediately.
