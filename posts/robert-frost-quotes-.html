            <span>
 All of us would have read the famous quote by Robert Frost:
</span>
<ul>
 <li>
  <span>
   "Woods are lovely, dark and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles and miles ot go before I sleep".
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>
<span>
 But has anyone heard the following two quotes by the same man ?
</span>
<ul>
 <li>
  <span>
   "Until that point, he was lonely and desperate. Then his life took a turn. Then, he was desperate and lonely."
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span>
   "A bank is a place where they lend you an umbrella during fair weather, and ask for it back when it rains".
  </span>
 </li>
</ul>
<span>
 Satire at its best ! :)
