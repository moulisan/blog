            Nope. I have not written one. But I found a great one.

I wanted to write a few words on this one. I think this is a great tutorial for someone who knows programming and wants to get kick-started on a project. For a scripting language, the typical thought process of a programmer is that, it should not require you to sit down with a book for a week to get to know it. The typical process is to sit down with an O'Reilly book as a reference and get running.

Except, sometimes, the first version of the script takes a long time. This is mostly because, one does not know the basics of this scripting language. You will be spending a lot of time trying to find out "equivalents". What is the equivalent of a for-loop in Python. How does one do if-elseif in Pythong. Stuff like that. This tutorial does exactly that. Gives you a birds-eye view of all of these "equivalents". Once you have that in place, you are already running.
