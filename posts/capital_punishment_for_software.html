 'Working Smart'
</a>
writes about his recent decision to sentence software to death row. Over the last year, he has been using his '

 mac extensively and loving it'.
</span>
But he says that, he suddently found that an overwhelming 150 new software titles had gotten into his power book. And to reduce the clutter, he has created a folder called
