<h1>Endless pools</h1>
            Point to note: This is probably one of the first ever times, I clicked on an online ad in a webpage.

Endless pools is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen in a long long time. This thing is basically dubbed as the treadmill for swimmers. It is a small swimming pool (13x8) - the makers claim it can make it through any standard sized door. It has some mechanism by which blowers blow waves against the direction you swim. So in the small space, you just keep swimming hard, but you dont move (just like in a treadmill). Is that not just way too cool.
