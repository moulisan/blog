Went to Kamat Swad over the weekend. I had tried the Jowar Meals here before (well I had tried it at Kamat Bugle Rock), but the wife had not tried it before .This is one type of meals that is worth trying atleast once. My review of Kamat Swad and the Jowar Meals:
<ul>
 <li>
  Excellent ambience - 3rd floor of Kamat Swad .
 </li>
 <li>
  Directions: From Sony World Junction, Koramangala, drive towards BDA Koramangala. You will see a Panasonic show room on the left. Make an Uturn immediately. The Kamat is the second building on the left, once you make the U-Turn
 </li>
 <li>
  Despite being the top floor, the A/C was tuned beautifully to be at the perfect temperature - not too cold, not too hot. Both the wife and me had the exact same comparison - it felt like being under a tree.
 </li>
 <li>
  The 3rd floor serves only Jowar Meals. But I did see a family in the next table, for whom, the waiter had brought Idly from the first floor for the baby. Good customer service, Kamat. Keep it up. There are some hotels, who just go overboard with their rules.
 </li>
 <li>
  The meal is served on a clean banana leaf.
 </li>
 <li>
  Awesome buttermilk is served initially, and also topped up.
 </li>
 <li>
  A dhokla type appetizer and toasted papad is served.
 </li>
 <li>
  A few leaves - I have no idea what leaves - are served. Peer pressure made me swallow my pride and swallow the leaves as well :)
 </li>
 <li>
  The main meal starts off with Holige (for the tamil folk - this is our traditional poli ; and for the Maharashtrians, this is the Puran Poli). Awesome stuff, especially with the generous spoon of ghee :)
 </li>
 <li>
  3 gravies and one raita are served. 2 of the gravies are legume based - sprouts, channa, peanuts etc. This brings out the similarity in food between the North Karnataka regions, and Maharashtra. There is one egg-plant based gravy. The gravy was consumed with gusto, and the eggplant was gingerly kept aside (I hate eggplant!!).
 </li>
 <li>
  The star of the show obviously is the super soft Jowar roti's that are served. A small cube of butter is initially put on the roti. You can ask for more if you want. But the roti's keep coming, and coming .. until you say STOP. :)
 </li>
 <li>
  Then white rice is served. And Sambar, Rasam, and curds.
 </li>
 <li>
  An ice-cream with fruit-salad is the finisher.
 </li>
 <li>
  The above is the special meal. The difference between the special and regular meal is that the special meal has the poli, and ice-cream etc.
 </li>
 <li>
  Service is Ok. As regular readers would note, our bar was not quite met. We had to ask for refill of water.
 </li>
 <li>
  Even before we were finished, the bill and 2 bananas (wierd combination) were brought and kept at our table. I guess that was an indirect suggestion to scoot.
 </li>
 <li>
  Reasonably priced meal (Rs 160 per person)
 </li>
</ul>
