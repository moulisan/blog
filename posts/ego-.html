            Steve Pavlina has written a nice piece in his blog about why you should not be worrying what other people think of you. A few quick take-aways from his post:
<blockquote>
 <ul>
  <li>
   At the time during which you are worrying about what other people are thinking of you, they are actually worrying about what you are thinking about them. Henceforth, everyone spends time worrying about what everyone else are thinking about them.
  </li>
  <li>
   Just because someone told you not to go through a path because it is wrong, do not just shrug it off. You may encounter failure (and they may point it out to you that they told you before), but that is ok. Now you have learnt your lesson, you brush off the dust and continue.
  </li>
  <li>
   Failure is not the opposite of success. They aid in the path to success.
  </li>
  <li>
   Self-trust is a far greater possession than anything you might lose along the way.
  </li>
  <li>
   Faith in yourself isn’t a result of success.  It’s the cause of it.
  </li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>
