            Disclaimer: This is not a paid post. I do have purchased from BigBasket a couple of times. The information contained in the post is my opinion on the way online marketing/retailing is changing.

I got an email in the morning from bigbasket.com. The email subject was to tout their latest android app. True to the subject, the first section of the email was a banner which described the arrival of their android app.

Nothing special about this. Then it went on to describe the latest deals. Nice bright pictures with their original price and the new deal price.

Again. Nothing special about this. I get atleast a couple of such emails these days.Then comes the kicker.

This seemingly innocuous note about Sona Masoori has more than what meets the eye. Firstly, it invitingly says, "A note by
<strong>
 Subramanyam J
</strong>
,National Head, Staples Merchandising". Intriguing. So I clicked on, and it took me
<a href="http://bigbasket.com/sonamasoori/?utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_term=n74+android+blr&amp;utm_source=Bigbasket&amp;utm_campaign=n74-android-blr">
 here

.

This page gives some very nice information on what is Sona Masoori rice. Where it is grown. Where the original rice comes from. What processing is done on it. And then, it also says, where BigBasket sources this rice from. It then goes on to give the quality metrics that it observes. And the yield. Yes, get that, the yeild. How much cooked rice does a cup of uncooked rice yield?

Wow. You dont get that information from 'any' grocer that you visit. Just not possible. This is where online retailing is headed to. And I like it.
