points to a great PCWorld article, where the PCWorld guys hit the labs with cartridges from prominent ink jet printers (Canon, HP, Kodak, Epson). In a nutshell,

They found out that
<ul>
 <li>
  Almost all of these guys except HP stopped printing after some low ink warnings. HP continued printing (kinda like duracell) until the ink totally ran dry.
 </li>
 <li>
  All the cartridges start giving out low ink warnings (and some even shutdown), when there is a large quantity of ink still left -- upto a whopping 45% of the original ink left! What a waste !!
 </li>
 <li>
  They also found out that for most of these printers (except Kodak), printers reported low ink on aftermarket cartridges earlier than original cartridges.
 </li>
</ul>
All this is good info -- but something at the back of my mind tells me, "Hmm, did HP pay PCWorld more than the other guys did ? ". Well, obviously all of them paid PCWorld for the comment that "original cartridges are better than third party catridges". Well, well .....
