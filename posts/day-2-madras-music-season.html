            <h1>Day 2: Madras Music Season</h1>
            Had bought tickets for T. M. Krishna (7PM) at German Hall (Indian Fine Arts). The ticket is for both the 4:00PM and the 7:00PM concert. The 4PM concert was Hyderabad Brothers. So we (mother and me) reached there around 5PM (after getting tickets for Wednesday's Ranjani Gayathri concert in Rani Seethai Hall). Observations about the 2 concerts below.
<strong>
 Hyderabad brothers - Indian Fine Arts (German Hall)
</strong>
<ul>
 <li>
  Went in about an hour after the concert had started. It had not quite warmed up yet.
 </li>
 <li>
  About 50% of hall was empty.
 </li>
 <li>
  SriMushnam on the mridangam was just fantastic.
 </li>
 <li>
  Manasu swadinamai (Sankarabharanam) was soulfully rendered, but something was missing (my opinion).
 </li>
 <li>
  Simlar case with Shanmugapriya. Shanmugapriya when well rendered, can make you soar. Did not happen for me. I was still in my seat.
 </li>
 <li>
  About 7ish (when they should have finished), they were still going. Thani Avarthanai started at 6:50PM. Pretty bad time management.
 </li>
 <li>
  The secretary mama, after trying to give lots of secret signals regarding time-up, and failing, moved into stage, and grabbed the mike, and said a few good words about the artists and said, "they will be concluding now." This (I think) pis*** off the brothers. And they sang, "Naan oru vilayattu bommaya" - a subtle way of saying - Do you think you can control me like your toy.
 </li>
 <li>
  They sang 2 more songs and closed up at 7:10PM.
 </li>
</ul>
<strong>
 T. M. Krishna
</strong>
<ul>
 <li>
  This was just another play ground all together.
 </li>
 <li>
  The sabha had filled up to the brim.
 </li>
 <li>
  TM Krishna was at his best - just brilliant.
 </li>
 <li>
  Two small songs + 2 RTP (Ragam Thanam Pallavi's) + 2 small songs
 </li>
 <li>
  Excellent time management.
 </li>
 <li>
  Both the RTPs were off unusual raagams, and he said out the ragams. I really appreciate the artists letting us know what they are singing. Makes me appreciate the music better (else I am quizzing myself in my brain, as to what ragam it is!).
 </li>
 <li>
  First RTP was in Narayanagowla (it was Vaikunta ekadasi yesterday).
 </li>
 <li>
  Second RTP was in Rishabapriya (very closely resembling Shanmugapriya).
 </li>
 <li>
  Guruvayoor durai on the mridangam did his magic.
 </li>
 <li>
  Performance par excellence.
 </li>
 <li>
  He has inherited the "playing-with-the-swarams" capability from Semmangudi.
 </li>
</ul>
