            <h1>Warren Buffet to give away 85% of his wealth</h1>
            Warren Buffet to start a steady process of donating 85% of his fortune - mostly to the worlds largest philanthrophic society - Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. This is in the order of billions by the way. Wow. Just recently Bill Gates announced that he is stepping down from the throne at Microsoft and he is going to concentrate on his philanthrophy.
