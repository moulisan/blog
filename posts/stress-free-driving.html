<h1>Stress free driving</h1>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 I recently realized that I felt very tired after driving to and from
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 work. Traffic in Bangalore can be maddening at times, and can invoke
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 inordinate amounts of stress in the body. The result of this stress
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 is extreme tiredness, general sluggishness, and  general unhappiness
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 from R.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 For the last 2-3 days, I have been trying out something, that has worked
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 (atleast until now), that has reduced my stress multiple fold.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 Imagine you are the driver of one of those super luxury volvo buses.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 These guys, if you notice, never are in a hurry. And if you have been
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 inside one, you would realize, it is one of the smoothest drives you
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 have ever taken. I am not talking about not feeling the bumps (Good
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 Volvo suspension takes the credit for that). I am talking about, not
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 feeling any surges in power, to get the bus between those 2 cars, or,
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 suddenly decelerating from 60kmph to 0kmph, to avoid that dog/child/
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 oldlady/vegetable cart/cycle that just crossed the road. You do not
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 feel it, because the driver does not do these things.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 - He never is above 40-45kmph.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 - He never is weaving in and out of traffic
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 - He never needs to accelerate or decelerate suddenly
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 - He is never in a hurry
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 I thought let me follow this. And hey, it works. I do not overspeed
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 these days. I do not weave in traffic. I am always in the lookout
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 for pedestrians/traffic stoppers, and speed bumps. I imagine, I am
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 driving the world's best super luxury bus.
</font>
<font face="trebuchet ms">
 Here's to stress-free driving!
