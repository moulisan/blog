<h1>Om Arunachala</h1>
            Last weekend, I did a whirlwind road-trip. Left Bangalore Friday afternoon at around 245PM, reached Thirvannamalai around 630PM. Stayed there overnight. Early morning, had dharshan of Lord Arunaachaleswara, and left for Kumbakonam by around 745AM. Reached by around noon. Stayed there overnight. Picked up the wife and baby, and started for Bangalore early .. around 630AM. Reached Bangalore around 5in the evening. Fairly fatigueing trip. One way is around 400km (slightly short of it). Did not take too many snaps, but here, for your viewing pleasure, I have two snaps of the Adi Arunaachaleswara temple in Thiruvannamalai.
