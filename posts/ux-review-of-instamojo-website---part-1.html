<h1>UX review of Instamojo website - part 1</h1>
            I recently tried signing up with Instamojo and gave it a spin. Instamojo is a pretty cool payment related startup. Their moto is to democratize payments. It should be dead easy for anyone to be able to sell (start a business) and be able to set up a payment mechanism for customers. Instamojo would do the heavy lifting of the payment gateway etc.

Following are my thoughts on the UX/UI of the website.
<strong>
 Signup:
</strong>
In the screen which asks for how I got to know about instamojo, why is social media conspicuously absent?
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta1.jpg">
<img alt="insta1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3739" height="689" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta1.jpg" width="409"/>
</a>
<p>
In the next screen, your KYC is collected (incidentally, there is no place which gives the full form of KYC - Know your customer - if someone from outside of India in the future tries signing on, they would be clueless). Also, what if I want to sell an ebook for Rs.49 (a fairly common denomination to sell an ebook in India), there is no option for this.

</a>
<p>Then, in the next screen, I tried uploading a PDF (scanned pan card) and this is what I got. Also, there should be somewhere it says, only image files (GIF/JPG/TIFF etc).
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta3.jpg">
<img alt="insta3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3741" height="183" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta3.jpg" width="353"/>
</a>
<p>The following also is confusing. Is the status bar saying .. half way through uploading my pan card picture or is it saying I am half way through uploading my documents? If it is the latter, should it not be 50% (1 out of 2 documents?)
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta4.jpg">
<img alt="insta4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3742" height="459" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta4.jpg" width="404"/>
</a>
<p>While I understand that by the time he has finished uploading kyc, the user is expected to know about payment links etc, I would still recommend a (?) link here next to the payment link leading him to the support page.

</a>
<p>When I click on share your referral link on twitter/facebook, the below appears when I click on twitter. I would prefer not just the link, but some template text such as : “I am using Instamojo. Are you? To sign up click here -&gt; url”

<p>Facebook is slightly better, but it could be better.

<p><strong>
 Create a Payment Link
</strong>
I got to the file-picker page (which is awesome by the way! - the options are truly exhaustive).

I dragged and dropped by file. But after dropping the file, I realized that the file was named wrongly (similar scenario to I dropped the wrong file). Now how do I delete this file and put the correct file? No intuitive UX for the user for this action. I would have liked the file (Samkshepa Ramayana.pdf in the case below) to be in a table, with a trash can in a last column, giving me the option to delete the file.
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta8_1.jpg">
<img alt="insta8_1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3748" height="432" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta8_1.jpg" width="772"/>
</a>
<p>The only way I could do it was to navigate away from this page (to Dashboard) and then click on Create Payment Link. I see two problems here.
<ol>
<li>
  You should warn the user if he is going to navigate away from a page which he has filled in mid-way.
 </li>
<li>
  I get this thought that - what happened to the file I dragged-and-dropped, was it uploaded, aborted, cached - where did that go? When I went back to creating a new payment link, it is not even reminding me that I was doing one half-way some time back.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>Minor CSS nitpick - spacing between the i,? and the text
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta9.jpg">
<img alt="insta9" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3749" height="72" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta9.jpg" width="498"/>
</a>
By this time, my account had already been verified - awesome speed. Love it. Is this manual ?
<p>
I got the following email:
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta10.jpg">
<img alt="insta10" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3750" height="249" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta10.jpg" width="699"/>
</a>
<p>While a lot of services do this, I have always liked to be addressed by name instead of my userid. And then I went to the Settings -&gt; Accounts to see if you had been able to capture my name. And I saw that the names were blank.
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta11.jpg">
<img alt="insta11" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3751" height="425" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta11.jpg" width="709"/>
</a>
I am wondering if you could have auto populated the name somehow - from my name on my PAN card that you collected during KYC.
<strong>
<p> Phone verification:
</p></strong>
The below UI is very confusing. The 1234 is very confusing. That is not the norm. Either put * * * * or - - - - or just blank or put 4 squares.
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta12.jpg">
<img alt="insta12" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3752" height="191" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/insta12.jpg" width="217"/>
</a>
<p>Also, I was updating my settings (one by one), at the end of verification, why do I get the option to only go back to dashboard? I want to go back to the settings page.

<p>Minor English suggestion. I would prefer Connect
<b>
 to
</b>
your Social Networks and “Connect to Twitter”.

Also, why not Facebook and g+. I saw those two in other places along with twitter.
<p>
Also, the “We will not post …..” should probably be darker. It is a very reassuring message and should be prominent.
<p>
Well, that's about it. Hope the Instamojo teams gets to these minor nitpics from an amateur UX reviewer. In my opinion, getting these small things right is one of the key drivers to showing your classiness in an already crowded market place (in the case of instajojo - the payments marketplace).
