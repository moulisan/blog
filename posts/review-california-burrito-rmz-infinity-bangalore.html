            <h1>Review: California Burrito, RMZ Infinity, Bangalore</h1>
            This is a new eatery opened at the food court at RMZ Infinity, Old Madras Road, Bangalore. California and Burritos? Yeah sure, California has a lot of Latino population, but never really associated these 2 names. Perhaps a competition to California Pizza Kitchen (which incidentally, I cannot place the association either).

It is the first week that the restaurant has been open. So this place was crowded. The food was good too. Again, the above two comments are probably because of the first week factor. We would have to check it out a month later and then figure.
<ul>
 <li>
  Had the Spicy Panneer Burrito. The Burrito is fairly authentic. Slightly sticky on the outside. Warmed a little bit. The other options are salad bowl style and hard taco.
 </li>
 <li>
  Next the filling. The two veggie options were spicy panneer and barbeque panneer. Panneer in a burrito is mixed-racial already. I didnt want to mix one more cuisine (bbq) in it. So spicy panneer it was.
 </li>
 <li>
  You get an option of Pinto beans or black beans. And you get to choose if you want it spicy or not. I chose spicy pinto.
 </li>
 <li>
  Additions include guacamole, sour cream, jalapenos, and grilled veggies. I took grilled veggies, guacamole, and sour cream. I was a little wary about the guacamole, but it was done just right.
 </li>
 <li>
  Each of the above steps is a different guy. So it is a three person assembly line operation. Fairly swift and efficient. The last guy rolls the burrito and gives it to you in a bowl.
 </li>
 <li>
  I also took a side of chips and salsa. Right amount of crisp and salt. The salsa was fresh as well.
 </li>
</ul>
<strong>
 Damage to wallet
</strong>
was Rs. 150.
<strong>
 Verdict:
</strong>
Pretty good (for now). If only they can sustain the quality, I think this would be a good place for a lunch.
<strong>
 Advise (for now):
</strong>
Reach before 1PM. Gets super crowded. Not much seating left. So you would have folks waiting for you to finish and get up (a la CTR/MTR style).
