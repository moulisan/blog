            <h1>Restaurant Review: The Elegant Elephant</h1>
            We have been wanting to try this out for a while. This is on the same building as The Great Indian Thali - Near Sony World Signal - Koramangala.

  <strong>
   Serving type
  </strong>
  - Buffet - but served to the table. Not sure, if this is always like this, or, was yesterday an exception - because of low crowds.
 </li>
 <li>
  <strong>
   Crowd
  </strong>
  - there was very less crowd

  <strong>
   Food
  </strong>
  <ul>
   <li>
    The starters and the gravy had _no_ salt in them. And when I say no salt, I mean no salt, not less salt. Unfortunately, starters are something that you cannot 'add' more salt on. We did sprinkle away saltiness on our gravy to make it pallatable.Starters were Paneer Tikka, Baby Corn, and Corn Tikka.
   </li>
   <li>
    One paneer gravy. One mix veg gravy. And one mushroom gravy (which we turned back - both R and I are not fans of Mushroom). Dal Tadka. Plain roti, Butter Naan, and Kulcha made up the roti basket. The Paneer was fresh (both in the starter and in the gravy). The rotis were not that great either. The dal was the only palatable side dish. For some reason, the chef put salt in it.
   </li>
   <li>
    Jeera rice and Plain rice was the rice 'varieties'. Again Jeera rice had zero salt, but this is a matter of preference between chefs.
   </li>
   <li>
    Desserts were the only good thing to have happened - Gajar Halwa, Gulab Jamun, and Butter scotch icecream.
   </li>
   <li>
    The over all service was fantastic though. The waiters filled water glasses even without asking. Jumped up in serving us when our plates were done. Great service I should say.

  <strong>
   Ambience.
  </strong>
  There are two seating areas. One is the terrace. We skipped this. Was too bright for comfort in the afternoon. And there is an A/C dining room inside. This was nice and cool. Minimally decorated but clean. Washrooms etc were maintained well.
 </li>
 <li>
  Damage to wallet: Rs 950 for two - all inclusive.
 </li>
 <li>
  My opinion - Not worth it at all.
