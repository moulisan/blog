Well, saturday morning was spent with God (temple visiting). Visited Agara village and caught up with half a dozen temples (including the 108ft tall Anjaneya and the 150 yr old Venkateswara temple).

Sunday afternoon was spent in gluttony.Hmmm. Shiok is defenitely a place, one should go to, atleast once. I would go there once more, for sure. The service, the food, and the ambience rocks. You notice the very good service right from the time, you park your car. The valet grabs your keys and a steward ushers you inside, and seats you. The ambience is simple, but very oriental. One ultimate thing is that, there is a separate vegetarian section in the

 menu
</a>
!! Yippee.

We asked the steward to suggest a good veg starter, and he suggested the
<strong>
 crispy vegetables in chillies, garlic, and basil
</strong>
(a Thai dish). It was indeed very good. The thai spices soaked in the crispy veg was delectable to say the least. Pleased with the steward's taste, we asked for a recommendation for the main course. It was surprising (refreshingly surprising) that the steward said, that usually one dish fits two people. It is pretty rare, restaurants are candid about this. You usually end up hauling a lot of food home. So there we were, having ordered the '
<strong>
 Fresh green beans, tofu, and carrots with ginger and chillies
</strong>
'. And we had ordered it with '
<strong>
 Chinese stir fried noodles'
</strong>
.Â  The combination was amazing. R did feel it was a little spicy though. I have peculiar taste-buds - Even the slightest spice can be very spicy at home, but outside food, I dont feel the spice at all !'. After the meal, both of us felt just full -- we did not get the how-the-he**-are-we-going to get out of the chair feeling :-)

Apparently Shiok is celebratng their fifth anniversary, so they had a lucky draw - and so R won a cooking session with the chef -

(oh did I mention, this guy was a techie before he started his restaurant ! :)). We need to schedule this sometime in the future, at our convenience. Service is amazing - when the bill is getting paid, the steward grabs your valet token, and by the time, you are done paying the bill, your car is at the door.

Well, gluttony rarely ends in one place ! Shiok does not have a dessert menu. And I recollected one of my colleagues at work, mentioning about a kulfi joint in Indira nagar (hey Im at Domlur, might as well, jump across the flyover to Indiranagar). So off we went. ANd we found the place -- Bombay Chowpati Kulfi'. Brilliant in one word. THey have kulfi in about 10 flavours - ranging from 32/- to 50/-. I had dry fruit kulfi and my wife had chikkoo. And then we shared a banana kulfi. The flavours are beautifully infused into the kulfi. Do not keep wondering, go and taste it. Fitting end to our gluttony.

Thathaasthu.
