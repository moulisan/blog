 I will be on a brief hiatus for the next 7 days. Leaving for home (Chennai) for Diwali holiday. For non-Indian viewers, Diwali is called the festival of lights and is probably the hindu equivalent of the holiday (christmas) season in the US. Houses all over India have brightly coloured lights decorating their frontage.Read the wikipedia entry for

 I do not think I will be posting for the next one week or so.

Ciao !
