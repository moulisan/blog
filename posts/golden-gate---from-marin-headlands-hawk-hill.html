            <h1>Golden Gate - From Marin Headlands (Hawk Hill)</h1>
            This time when I had gone to the Bay area, I lost out on a weekend, because of British Airways. I still adore the Golden Gate, and the quaint city of San Francisco. I would have hated myself, if I had not dragged myself there. So on the day of my leaving, I dragged my behind out of bed early 6AM, and off to the Marin headlands I went. Super foggy morning. Unfortunately a tad too foggy, that I could barely see the famed red bridge from top. It is a wonderful ride and you do get some other great views of the bay though. I had fun post processing these pictures though. (courtesy: ipiccy.com - my fav online image editor).
