<h1>Book Review: Sceptical Patriot</h1>
            I had been wanting to read this book for a while. I have followed the author (@sidin) for quite a while on a twitter. He does write pretty well, and there were several several good reviews of the book on the twitter feed.

So when the new kindle landed up on my door step, this was the first book I bought.
<ul>
<li>
  The book starts off at a brisk gallop. Sidin gives his reasonings on why he started writing this book. And the proclamation that this would not be a dry history book, but more of an enjoyable read of Indian history and some of its misinterpretations.
 </li>
<li>
  I liked the idea of taking apart of a few 'India facts' and also the concept of giving a rating to it at the end of each fact. This rating shows how much of the 'fact' is truth.
 </li>
<li>
  I really enjoyed his in-depth research of some of the topics. Most of the history of India can actually found only in history analysis books written by Europeans. Sidin's readings of these books saves us time, money, and energy. He condenses them wonderfully into smaller chunks we can digest.
 </li>
<li>
  There is not much of a humour (as he claims) but the light hearted writing style makes one smile at times. Well, I guess that is what humour is.
 </li>
<li>
  The chapter on the Cholas was a delight to read - it has always been one of my pet peeves that, this chapter was never covered in depth in our school history books. For the extent of the empire that the Cholas had, this deserves a full chapter in a history book. not a paragraph on the Tanjore temple.
 </li>
<li>
  Cantering on, however, one of Sidin's choices of the India facts gets a little too dry, and this is strictly my opinion. And this is probably because of his self-confessed bias towards some areas. Any author who writes about something that he is more passionate about, will write more and with deeper interests in those areas. And yes, I am talking about the 'India was the richest country' fact. Perhaps, it is my aversion to economics, and 'numbers' in general, which put me off, but folks who like that kind of thing will surely enjoy it. Just not my cup of tea (it should actually be coffee!).
 </li>
<li>
  The last two chapters are well written. This is Sidin's heart talking on what his dreams are. And how the facts in these books should be interpreted, and why Indians are the way Indians are. Ofcourse, this is subject to personal opinions. I agree with some parts, and am neutral to some. I am sure other readers would feel the same way too. I would go to the extent of saying, that the last chapters some times does get a little prescriptive, which might not bode too well with some readers.
 </li>
</ul>
On the whole an enjoyable read. It took me about 3 days of a few hours reading every day on my kindle.
