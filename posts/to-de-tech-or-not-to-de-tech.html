<h1>To de-tech or not to de-tech</h1>
            Doug from

has an excellent writeup on whether or not to de-tech. De-tech is by the way a nice cool term for moving away from technology. He explains in the post as to how, one should not think that we should move away from technology completely. We should open. De-teching is not a religion.
<blockquote>
 The best advice I can possibly give those people looking to the "Analog Revolution" for some sort of salvation or release from their shackles: don't take anything too seriously --it's not a religion, or even an idealogical movement-- and don't look at de-teching as an all-or-nothing affair. Keep your mind open, and don't automatically assume that technology
 <em>
  must
 </em>
 or
 <em>
  must not
 </em>
 be used to solve your issues and lead a creative and productive life.
