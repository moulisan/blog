<h1>My latest email hack to get to / Stay at Inbox Zero</h1>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
 To set context, I am a very heavy email user. I tend to not like unread emails. I like to respond in a timely fashion (often times, very quickly). I am always on the lookout for good hacks. This is for my official email. I ðŸ’— Inbox-Zero.

  Emails that I get are either actionable or archived for later reference
 </li>
<li>
  Those that are actionable are:
  <ol>
<li>
    emails that I need to reply to
   </li>
<li>
    emails that I need to follow-up on / be on my radar
   </li>
<li>
    emails that I need to read later / watch later (meeting recordings etc)
   </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
 As far as the 'archive' part in (1), I just hit Archive button. Exchange email search is pretty good. If the desktop ain't that good, the Outlook Web Exchange (OWA) is leagues ahead. So you can choose. (I usually go to OWA for searching purposes).
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
 For the ones that are actionable, if I can respond quickly to an email immediately, without having to refer anything or having to write a long-form email (I try as much as possible not to do this) and hence most likely not taking more than 30s, I action immediately.
</p>

 For those emails that I need to read, refer, respond in detail, it goes into a folder called _Current (the underscore is an old habit to bubble up in text sort). Just adding it as a favourite folder is good enough actually. Other emails that go into the _Current folders are misc to-dos that I need to keep track of or det done.
</p>

 I usually am following up stuff closely with &lt;5 people. In my current scenario it is 3 - two of my direct reports and my engineering manager peer. All emails that are on the radar for follow-up go into the respective _Current&lt;Person&gt; folder.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>
 Automated system emails from AzureDevops, FinanceReports, HR automated emails go into respective folders using Rules.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>
 I keep scanning my Inbox 2-3 times a day to funnel stuff into the above CurrentFolders. Once or twice every week in my team meeting or 1-1s, I chug through the _Current&lt;person&gt; folders. It remains there if it requires more follow-up, or gets archived when done.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>
 I have been doing this for the last 2-3 weeks, and it has been working like a charm. Let's see how it works in the long run. One of the things I know I would need to worry about later, if there are more folks that I need to follow-up closely with. But then limiting that list would reflect my management / delegation abilities.
