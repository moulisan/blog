<li>
  Terminal change. And DEL - BLR by Indigo (6E 2423) at around 1PM.

  The best way to do pilgrimage in this part of the world -  is to take the services of a local cab person.
 </li>
<li>
  I had gotten the contacts of Mr. Prem from Twitter (@mohithkrishna). Mohith had done a couple of trips with him.
 </li>
<li>
  Mr. Prem is from Rishikesh, has a well maintained Ertiga, and has been doing these trips in around the Char Dham for the last 22 years!. There is no online booking etc. You call him up. He writes down in his diary.
 </li>
<li>
  You communicate/remind/confirm using Whatsapp. Since he had seen my DP and I his, on Whatsapp, it was super easy for him to locate us.

<ul>
<li>
  All accommodation was booked with Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd (GMVNL) - through their online portal -
  <a href="http://gmvnl.in">
   gmvnl.in
  </a>
  .  Horrible user interface, but hey - online booking + payment works.
 </li>
<li>
  Note: If you want to book for one night - say Check-in on Oct 5th noon and check out Oct 6th morning - choose Oct 5th and Oct 5th as From and To dates. ;-)
 </li>
<li>
  You will get email confirmations.
 </li>
<li>
  GMVN is never fancy. Spacious basic bedrooms and relatively clean bathrooms. Government organisation. Best locations guaranteed though.
  <em>
   Be prepared for warm good staff but with extreme Government inefficiencies though.

  Day1 (Saturday):

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
  Dehradun airport is closer to Rishikesh airport than Dehradun city. So plan accordingly. Prem-ji met us at the airport and it is about a 40 minute drive of really good paved road to Rishikesh. Reached Ganga resort within an hour. Checked in comfortably. Freshened up.
 </li>
<li>
  Left around 5ish to Paramarth Niketan for Gangaji Aarti. Have seen this before and it is one of the best in Rishikesh (second being at Triveni Ghat).

  Day 2 (Sunday):

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
  Prem-ji had made it very clear. 12 hours to Badrinath from Rishikesh. So if we start at 430AM, we reach at 430PM. The later we leave, the later we reach Badrinath, and it would suck if we reach late.
 </li>
<li>
  We left at 430AM :-)
 </li>
<li>
  Brilliant views of the Garhwal Himalayas from the get go. And horrible roads from the beginning as well.

<strong>
  Dev Prayag -
 </strong>
 The first of the 5 Prayags that we would encounter on the way and back. Prayag means the confluence of 2 or more rivers. The Ganga river system gets built in these 5 Prayags. At Dev Prayag, The Alaknanda and Bhagirathi join to form what is formally known as Ganga, henceforth.

 As we trudge uphill, the Alaknanda is still a fairly large river, meandering, cutting across the Garhwal Himalayas. As you will see in the full post below, the Alaknanda will follow us for most of the journey uphill.

<strong>
   Note:
  </strong>
  If you are from the South and are used to well cooked mashed rice, do not order rice items. Rice is usually cooked very rare here. Almost undercooked. My son had a bit of a minor stomach upset because of this.

  We reached bang on time at 430PM. New found respect for Prem-ji for his estimation skills. But then 21 years - what can you expect. Checked in to Devlok. And then had a darshan of Badri Narayan-ji.
 </li>
<li>
  October is almost the end of the season for Badrinath. The temple closes for winter by Diwali (November first week). There was barely any crowd in the temple.
 </li>
<li>
  But then, it was cold. Verrryy cold. It was sub-10 degrees celsius in the evening. Dipped down to -3 deg celsius in the night and early morning. Be very prepared with warm clothes. Gloves. Caps. At least two layers of sweaters.
 </li>
<li>
  Dinner was at Devlok. Basic roti + dal stuff.

<strong>
  Day 3
 </strong>
 (Monday):  After an eventful Day 2, and a great darshan of Badri Vishal, Day 3 was the trudge back to Rishikesh.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
  Had toast and tea at Devlok - which is the only thing that was available at 730AM. Yep. The same 12 hour rule applies for the return journey too. But then, you are closer to home (Rishikesh) and descended most of the mountains by the time the sun sets.
 </li>
<li>
  On the way back, we stopped by the Shankar Mutt at Joshimath. There is a cave temple where Thotakacharya (first disciple of Adi Sankara) had meditated. There is also the Spatika Linga that Adi Sankara had installed for the Mutt. Very calm and serene place.

  Day 4 (Tuesday):
 </strong>
 We had done Hardwar Rishikesh a couple of times before (when I used to live in Noida long ago). So, this time, we decided to explore Dehradun and surrounding places. We were in for a treat.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
  Sahasradhara - Sulphur springs (not hot). A small cable car ride and a park for kids. We went up for the view. Cross the small river, and there is a cave with a Shiva Linga, where Dronacharya is supposed to have meditated. Nothing spectacular - except for the Drona cave.

   Anandam
  </a>
  . Pure veg restaurant. Chats and combo meals were awesome.
 </li>
<li>
  Tapkeswar Mahadev temple - this was a golden find. Beautiful Shiva temple. Couple of cave temples too. One of these caves is where Aswathama (Drona's son) was supposed to have been born. The small Tamasa river flows by serenely. We took a nice break here. Dipped our feet in the river and just enjoyed the beauty.

  Headed back to Rishikesh by around 7ish. Did a quick trip to the Triveni Ghat for one last Ganga-ji darshan. The great river flowing swiftly into the night is something that needs to be experienced.
 </li>
<li>
  Then on to Rishilok, Rishikesh, in time for dinner / Night stay.

<strong>
  Day 5
 </strong>
 :
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<li>
  Flight was at 7AM. So rise up early morning. Pack up and head to the Dehradun airport. Bid Good bye to Prem-ji. Settle payment. It is amazing how he operates completely out of trust. No advance payments. I had paid a couple of times for Diesel during the trip, and he reduced that amount, collected the balance amount and done.
 </li>
<li>
  Brief transit at Delhi airport - where we had some food. And then back to Bangalore in the 1PM flight.
 </li>
<li>
  Reached Bangalore by 4ish. End of a brilliant trip.

<b>
  History/Context for trip
 </b>
 : My mother has been wanting to go to Badrinath for quite a long while. Both my father and mother had (and still have) heart ailments and had been advised not to do any sort of trekking or high altitude gimmickry. Badrinath is the only one of the four Char Dham shrines, which does not require you to do any trekking/walking. You can drive all the way up to Badrinath.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
 We decided to do it as comfortably as feasible ~ given that the parents are in the later part of their sixties. I tweet stormed most of what is there above, but blogging it here for posterity and for a one-stop-notes place.
