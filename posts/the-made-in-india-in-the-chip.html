<h1>The 'Made in India' in the chip</h1>
            This is a follow-up post to the previous Intel Xeon post. I just wanted to mention that, for the graphic below, I took a regular Intel chip picture from Google Images, and added the Made in India myself. And ohh, yes!, my chest swelled up with pride when I did that. It was a peculiar feeling, and just cannot be described.

I recalled a joke, that I had heard, in younger days about an American, a Russian, and an Indian designing an airplane. The American constructs the plane structure. The Russian puts in the engines and other machinary. The Indian paints "Made in India" on the plane and grins.

Well, I now proclaim that the above joke is no longer funny !!

We did it ! We designed it ourself and we have every right to paint 'Made in India' on it.
