            Awesome productivity blog thatvoodooyoudo.com :) writes an indepth article on how to get into the zone at work. Some very good advise. Some exerpts:
<blockquote>
 Your ability to concentrate can be trained, just as your body can. It is a slow, incremental process, and just like with physical training, the real gains are made through consistency rather than occasional bursts.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
 The Nine Components of Flow
 <ul>
  <li>
   Clear goals.
  </li>
  <li>
   A high degree of concentration on a limited field of attention.
  </li>
  <li>
   A loss of self-consciousness, the merging of action and awareness.
  </li>
  <li>
   Distorted sense of time. (he talks of power-of-48-minutes here)
  </li>
  <li>
   Direct and immediate feedback; behaviour can be adjusted as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
   Balance between ability level and challenge.
  </li>
  <li>
   A sense of personal control over the situation or activity.
  </li>
  <li>
   Intrinsically rewarding action, so there is an effortlessness of action.
  </li>
  <li>
   Focus of awareness is narrowed down to the activity itself.
  </li>
 </ul>
