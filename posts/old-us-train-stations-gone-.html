As many of you have probably figured out by now, I have a thing for trains. And if I have a thing for trains, obviously it extends to train stations. Given that, it was heart-wrenching to read this post in the Infrasturist, about how beautiful old railway stations have been razed to the ground, and ugly commercial structures have been built on them. Shame on those who did it. I am not blaming the US for this. There are so many beautiful old colonial style buildings in Chennai (on the Mount Road), which are giving away to ugly shiny glass framed 'modern' buildings. Shame on these guys too.
