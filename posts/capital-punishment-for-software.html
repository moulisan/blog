            <h1>Capital Punishment for Software</h1>
            Michael Hyatt of
<a href="http://www.michaelhyatt.com/workingsmart">
 'Working Smart'
</a>
writes about his recent decision to sentence software to death row. Over the last year, he has been using his '
<span>
 mac extensively and loving it'.
</span>
But he says that, he suddently found that an overwhelming 150 new software titles had gotten into his power book. And to reduce the clutter, he has created a folder called
<span>
 Death Row.
</span>
If he does not use any software in deathrow over the next 30 days, they would get uninstalled. Nice way to reduce clutter. Read the article
