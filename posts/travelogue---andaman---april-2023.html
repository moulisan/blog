 We did a 5 day trip to Andaman. Trip planning assistance was done through
 <a href="http://pickyourtrail.com">
  pickyourtrail.com
 </a>
 . The good part about planning your trip with guys like these are that, you get to plan your itinerary more or less by yourself (instead of one of those pre-planned boxed travel agent tour plans). Our requirements were simple. We wanted a relaxed holiday (did not want to keep running around). We wanted to spend some time in a resort with private beach access. The folks at PYT came up with a great plan. Lets dive into it in detail. Most opinions below are strictly mine. Your mileage may vary.

<strong>
  Day 1:
 </strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Fly from BLR to IXM (Port Blair). Dep 1130AM and arrival 2PM. Super wierd time, and we hate airline food for lunch. So we picked up sandwiches from Starbucks.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We had our Port Blair tour coordinator Arshad and a driver waiting at the arrival area with a name placard. (Will give phone number details etc at the end of the post).
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Arshad gave us the plan for the day, and logistics. He is like a genie kinda guy. Shows up at just the right time and the right locations to help you with next step logistics. Very impressive coordination mechanics.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We checked in to
  <a href="https://www.sinclairshotels.com/portblair">
   Sinclairs Bay View
  </a>
  . Great room (renovated recently) with fantastic views.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The property is kinda slightly aged and is in need of some sprucing up (exteriors, dining area, common area etc).  Food is ok-ok in the restaurant. The staff, however, is amazing levels of warm / friendly / smiling. This made up for a bunch of issues. They are genuine and try to help. (Example - there was a large group of about 80 pax (pharma company sales offsite) during the time we were there. The staff made sure to tell us to come to the restaurant ahead of the usual buffet time, so that, we can avoid the noise/rush when the large group comes). Our package had a breakfast and dinner included in the tariff.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  After we had freshened up, we headed off to the Cellular Jail. Spent about an hour or so soaking in the history of this place. Despite the crowds, it hits you hard on the kind of lives that the prisoners led here.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We had about an hour and half remaining for the sound and light show at the Cellular Jail. We sneaked a quick visit to the Corbyn Cove Beach. We were not impressed at all in this beach. Bunch of water sports. But nothing else.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We sped back to the Jail for the sound and light show - which was amazing. Tugs at your heart strings. Definitely emotional seeing the hard ships that some of our freedom fighters went though.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Back to our hotel room after this, had dinner and retired.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  During all this time, we had the phone number of our scorpio driver (Sarfu). Jio phone signal is weak but not completely absent. In most places, we had some weak signal. We were however told that, if there was any situation where we dont have signal, we could just flag down any tourist vehicle driver and ask to call to Arshad or Sarfu, and people would oblige. I found that fascinating.
 </li>

<strong>
  Day 2:
 </strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We had a ferry (
  <a href="https://makruzz.com/">
   Makruzz
  </a>
  ) to catch to Havelock at 8AM. Reporting time at the jetty is an hour before. Arshad had whatsapped the tickets the previous night. Sarfu was at the hotel in the morning. We had packed breakfast from the hotel (butter-cheese sandwiches  (tad bit small, which we were a bit disappointed with), a muffin, biscuits, an apple and a banana). When we reached the jetty, we saw that almost everyone in line had a similar packed breakfast paper bag in their hand.  The cruise is a large air conditioned catamaran type luxury boat. 90 min journey. Took us close to 2 hours though. You need to do security etc (pass bags through xray etc) at the jetty.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  On reaching Havelock, we had Basheer (who was our Havelock coordinator) waiting for us on the jetty with a driver (with a name placard). We were whisked to our hotel -
  <a href="https://sandyywavess.com/">
   Sandyy Wavess
  </a>
  . This is one of a half dozen resorts on a stretch of road with an access to the beach.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Super cozy rooms. Great pool. Neat access to the beach. Except please do plan with the tides - which can change the scene within a couple of hours. You would see an awesome beach, but in a few hours, the tide receeds significantly and the beach is just not useable. So enquire about this in advance. (And if this is not available, there is no point in booking a beach access resort). We had this issue.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The restaurant was a mess. Staff shortage (which I learnt from one of the servers whom we befriended). It was one chef churning out stuff. The food was good though, but would always take anywhere between 60-90 minutes at a minimum (which pissed us off quite a bit!). The food being good was the saviour. Breakfast and dinner was a buffet - so we needn't had to do the excruciating wait. Our package had a breakfast and dinner included in the tariff.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We went to the beach (on the property), relaxed a bit, and then in the evening headed to Radhanagar beach - apparently the 6th most cleanest beaches in Asia. True to this, the beach is an amazing one. Super clean. Fine sand. Great waves. Fantastic sunset.
 </li>

<strong>
  Day 3:
 </strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The first half was going to be to Elephanta Island - where all the water activities are organized. Contrary to its name, it is not an island, even though you take a speed boat to it. It is just a remote part of the same Havelock island, which you go by boat.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Super well organized again. You can buy tickets before you take the speed boat. You get assigned a speed boat. You got to remember the boat name (ours was Sea Lion 16). The boat waits for you for 3 hours and brings you back. You can also buy tickets at the destination.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  All guests get a complementary introductory 5 min snorkeling session. Basically a bait tactic to take the free session, and then lured to deeper waters. We wanted to do this towards the end, but we ran out of time and skipped it.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Our package had jetski and glass bottomed boat as part of it. The glass bottomed boat ride is awesome. You can see the corals and the coloured fish clearly.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We took a few extra rides - Black eye and Standing rides - which are just different kinds of inflatables pulled by a speed boat. (Wife and kid went on this). We also did Sea Walk (a unique experience) and para-sailing.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The Sea walk is a beautiful experience. You are taken to a platform away from shore. Ladders go down to the sea bottom from the platform. The area is netted all around (so that large fishes / sharks do not come in).
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  They put a 45 kg pressurized helmet on your head/shoulders and lower you down (climb down the ladder). Each person has a diver assigned and a photographer taking pics. You go down 20-30 feet to the ocean floor. The diver basically moves you around and shows you the corals, the colourful fishes (think nemo type fishes), and sets you up for good pics, which the photographer is busy shooting with a go-pro. This goes on for about 10-15 mins and then you are pulled up. This does momentarily make the ears pop for some folks (it did for me, did not impact my wife).
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Overall, the organization is wonderful for the kinds of crowds that this place gets.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Back at the hotel by around 130PM and we had food (had to wait 90 minutes for it though).
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We had the evening to ourselves, but we could not resist the urge to head back to the Radhanagar beach again.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
<strong>
  Day 4:
 </strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Time to head back to Port Blair. This time the ferry was
  <a href="https://gonautika.com/">
   Nautica
  </a>
  Lite. A very similar luxury boat. Same duration. The timing was slightly later. So we had the luxury of having a good breakfast buffet before the journey.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Back in Port Blair, we had planned lunch at Cafe Amaya. This roof top restaurant has continental fare and was recommended by PYT and others as well. The food was good and the view was awesome.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We had the evening to ourselves. We did a leisurely walk down to the Flag Point area (this is very close to the Sinclair BayView hotel). A good long walk. We visited this small temple - Alaikadal Ayyanaar. Beautiful temple. We walked down to the first ever tricolour flag that was hoisted by Subash Chandra Bose in 1943. History goes that, when the Japanese evacuated after WW2, they handed the islands to Bose, who was the supreme commander of the Azad Hind Fauj.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We walked past the awesome food trucks, and found one which was selling falooda/ice creams. Yumm-max ice creams was had. We skipped the other trucks, because we were not too confident about handling the veg and non-veg food together.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We popped into the Ramakrishna Mission for 10-15 minutes and listened to the evening aarthi.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Back at the hotel, we had a good dinner and retired.

<strong>
  Day 5:
 </strong>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Originally we did not have anything planned, but in the last minute, we had asked Arshad if there was something we had missed and could cover in a few hours. Our flight back to BLR was only at 230PM.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  We realized we had not seen Ross Island (Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Dweep - NSCB Dweep). This was the summer retreat for the British officers.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The place is in ruins with tree roots growing eerily over the ruined walls. But one can imagine, how grand it would have been during those times.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The tourism board has done a good job of putting concrete paths through these ruins all the way to the light house (and the lone sailor man statue) at the edge of the island ; and golf carts (for a fee) to ferry people around. This was super useful, given the scorching sun.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  The island has quite a few deer (saw many) and peacocks (did not get to see any). The golf card driver said that, the British had brought these deer to this island for food (venison). When the British left, there were about 15 deer, and now there are about 500 of them.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Headed back to the hotel in a couple of hours. Had an early lunch. Headed to the airport. And back in Bangalore for peak hour traffic at 530PM :-)

<li>
  The Andamans is super super hot in April. You can get dehydrated / zapped very easily. Wear shades and a hat. Put on sunscreen. Keep drinking water all the time. Interesting tidbit - you will only get 2 lt water bottles in most shops. An elderly shopkeeper lady explained why to us - people drink 1 lt bottle in one go and throw the bottles all over. 2 lt bottles however last for some time, and have a handle on top of the bottle.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Both the islands are super clean. Clean roads, pedestrian pathways. No plastic bottles (in the sea or on land). No junk. Was so heartening to see.

  The coordination among these organizers is impressive and you should not have to worry too much at all.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Airtel and BSNL have good signal strength across the islands, I am told. I had Jio and we had coverage in about 50% of the areas.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Take adequate cash when you head there. ATMs are available but do not risk it. Given spotty network connectivity, do not rely on UPI. Especially in Elephanta Islands / Havelock.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  PB resorts do not have beach access. Some have good views. We realized that this might not necessarily be that big a deal, for some folks.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Ask about the tides and when the beaches are usable.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->
<!-- wp:list-item -->
<li>
  Don't miss the Havelock water rides.
 </li>
<!-- /wp:list-item -->

<li>
  We did not do Neil island because we wanted a relaxed itinerary. If this is something that interests you, you should check it out as well.
