            <h1>Space Shuttle Endeavour last leg</h1>
            The space shuttle Endeavour was retired last week, and is being transported to a museum in Los Angeles (LA). For the last 12 miles, it was actually transported through LA roads.

Just imagine the awesome publicity that Toyota got. The da** trucked pulled the entire shuttle. For those folks, who do not live in the U.S, the Tundra is a pick-up truck that some normal people use as a 'car', for commuting to office etc.

And oh yeah, the Donut shop got a ton of publicity as well.
