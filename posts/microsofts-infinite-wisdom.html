<h1>Microsoft's Infinite Wisdom</h1>
            I had installed Windows Live Writer (Offline blogging tool), when it was in its infancy, and it was pretty good - small, lightweight, fast etc. So I wanted to give it another shot. Live writer is now a fully blown MS software, which means, it is now officially, bloated, slow, and big. It takes 8 seconds to load up. It has to install Live Image Gallery, even if you uncheck it etc etc. So as usual, I was disgusted, and uninstalled it. And I happened to see the below snapshot, while uninstalling.

Uninstalling installer ! If there is one thing that MS still maintains, it is entertainment value (in how ridiculous it can get!) ;-)
