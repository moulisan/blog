            <h1>Personalized Hotel Rooms ?</h1>
            There were serviced apartments that started popping up in cities like Bangalore a few years back. These were good alternatives to expensive full service hotels. A lot of frequent IT travelers liked these service apartments, because they were really good quality rooms, and they were inexpensive because they were no-frills. No service. Mostly no restaurants attached. This fit their bill perfectly.
<blockquote>
 But there was a problem. These service apartments were unorganized. You could only book them by calling them by phone. Some of them had a website, but most did not. Discoverability was a problem. This is being solved by a slew of new start-ups like

 , and

 .
</blockquote>
Now, allow me to add one more level of complexity into this problem - which could be a potential area where start-ups can spring up.

Personalized rooms. Seasoned business travelers love service apartments because of their no-frills approach, and are the ones who are fueling the reservation of these rooms through the new startups. But that does not mean to say that these travelers would not mind some personalization.Let me list a couple of immediate ideas that come to mind:
<ol>
 <li>
  Toiletries - For those who follow me on twitter, you would notice that this is a big peeve of mine. I am not a big business traveler, but I get irritated every time I am put through the "you-cannot-carry-toiletries-in-cabin-baggage'. This is the biggest bummer that happened after 9/11 in the US (which naturally percolated internationally). I would love to not carry toiletries at all during international travel. And you might ask - hey most hotels give you soap and some of them give you paste. I would want my brands to be there - cinthol/dettol soap + vicco tooth paste + fresh new brush + gillete mach3 razor+blade (disposable is fine) + nivea after shave gel. Now, if this is an add-on package to any of the room booking start-ups, I would glad plonk money on it.
 </li>
 <li>
  Travel - What if I can book a day cab or a cab for airport/station pickup or whatever need I have, while booking the room. Would that not be awesome? Sure, again, you might ask me, I could always use Uber/Ola/whatever to get the cabs on demand. But when I am on a business trip, I would like everything to be perfectly planned. I may sound pompous here - but I want my car waiting for me every time I want it. I would not want to be fiddling with my phone and getting a "No cars in your vicinity" message and getting stressed about it. Sure, the hotel could very well book an

   uber/
  </a>
  <a href="ola.com">

  </a>
  on my behalf - I dont care, but I want it to be waiting for me.
 </li>
 <li>
  Food - What if the hotel can offer me a fixed simple veg meal when I return back to my room at 8:30PM. A simple Mast Kalandar HP2 would be perfectly fine. But I would not want to be the one ordering it on the way back to my hotel, and giving directions, picking it up, paying, and all of that. It would be so much value for money for me to just get into the hotel, my food is waiting 'hot' in the reception, for me to take to my room, and have it in peace. Sure, the hotel can tie up with

  <a href="mastkalandar.com">
   mastkalandar
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="urbanspoon.com">
   urbanspoon
  </a>
  , whatever. They can even ask me where I want the food from. But again, sounding as pompous as I can, I want the food waiting for me, when I get to my room, after a tiring day. Hey they can get fancy too - they can save my preferences, and just confirm if I would like to order the same as last time. I know a lot of travelers do that. You could get fancier, by enabling the service apartment reception to call you once just to confirm if you would be needing dinner (what if - you suddenly get pulled into a client dinner type situation); or perhaps a push notification on your phone. A lot of stuff can be done in this area.

Well, enough dreaming for now. Got to get to my boring day job. :-)
