            One really cool thing about the Official Gmail blog is the informal nature of the posts. The latest one which is a lab feature which refreshes POP accounts at will, is an example. See for yourself:
<blockquote>
 <em>
  My little sister recently setup her Gmail account to retrieve messages from her school address, so she can check all of her email accounts in one place. She no longer has to constantly log in to two email programs, and she likes using Gmail's powerful interface for all her mail.
 </em>
 <em>
  However, sometimes she knows an email has already been sent to her school address, and she just can't wait for the next scheduled fetch to have it show up in her Gmail inbox. As any big brother would, I tried to solve this issue for her and millions of Gmail users.
 </em>
