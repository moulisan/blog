            Rumors of Google OS has been doing the rounds for quite some time. I just got this in my email - an NYTimes Flash News Report. And NO, it is not April 1st (April Fool).
<blockquote>
 <em>
  Google Plans to Introduce a PC Operating System

In a direct challenge to Microsoft, Google is expected to
announce on Wednesday that it is developing an operating
system for a personal computer based on its Chrome browser,
according to two people briefed on Google's plans.

The move would sharpen the already intense competition
between Google and Microsoft, whose Windows operating system
controls the basic functions of the vast majority of personal
computers.

Wow. I am waiting for tomorrow.
