 Howdy all ! I am back. Hope everyone in India had a safe and fun Diwali. I got back to reading some of the older articles (a week old) today morning, and the first thing that struck me as worthy of posting here was the following article on "How to avoid Monday Morning Blahs" (well fondly called blues).

  Many times we dread Monday mornings because we know that there are certain projects that we have to tackle for the week.  Why not get a headstart on Friday and begin something?

Have a leisurely breakfast.  Read the paper.  Exercise.  If you start out the day racing, it will have a negative effect on the flow of your day.
