<h1>December music season - 2009</h1>
            Thanks to the global recession, which has led to a shutdown in my company, I am here in Chennai, steeped in the Margazhi Music festival. I am here for a week, and I am going to allow myself to drown in the carnatic music. It has been a long time.

Yesterday was Day 1 - and here are my observations (I almost said review - but I am not that big to review such maestros).
<strong>
 Day 1:
</strong>
<strong>
</strong>
Artist: Shashank (Flute)

Date: 27-12-2009

Venue: Rama Bhaktha Samaj - PSBB School - KK Nagar.

  Awesome performance
 </li>
<li>
  Alapana rendered for Raagam Dharmavathi was amazing.
 </li>
<li>
  The ghana ragham was a Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in Raagam Bindu Malini. Beautifully melodious. In the pallavi, he beautifully slipped into a couple of popular raagams, and the flute was doing its magic. Beautiful strains of Hindolam, Sindhubhairavi and Arabhi kept the audience in a trance.
 </li>
<li>
  Enna thavam seidhanai (kaapi) always sounds awesome in flute.
 </li>
<li>
  Concert was wrapped up with a mellifluous Sindhu Bhairavi Annamacharya bhajan.
 </li>
<li>
  All-in-all spell bound evening. Thanks Shashank and team.
 </li>
<li>
  The violin (Ganesh Prasad) kept up with Shashank through the concert. Very able support.
 </li>
<li>
  Mridangam (Parupalli Phalgun) was also awesome.
 </li>
<li>
  Lastly, it was a great feeling to be back in my alma mater - brought back memories indeed.
