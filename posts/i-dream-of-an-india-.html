            I dream of an India where ...
<ul>
 <li>
  the streets are clean
 </li>
 <li>
  the Police is respected, responsive, and is the common man's friend
 </li>
 <li>
  there is no corruption
 </li>
 <li>
  the public transportation is awesome (enough, on-time, and clean)
 </li>
 <li>
  civic bodies work together and have non-intrusive infrastructure (no more digging up of the roads by one body after the other)
 </li>
 <li>
  Government offices work per clock-work (if the appropriate paper work is there, your work will get done)
 </li>
 <li>
  there is fair competition in the industry
 </li>
 <li>
  education is first-class, and world-oriented
 </li>
 <li>
  industrial infrastructure is world-class
 </li>
 <li>
  there is no pollution
 </li>
 <li>
  there is no hypocricy
 </li>
 <li>
  there are no reservations
 </li>
 <li>
  there is equal educational opportunity for all to succeed in any endeavour
 </li>
</ul>
*Sigh* I can dream, can't I ? Yet, I am confident some of this (and maybe even all) will happen.
