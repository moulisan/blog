            Ok, dear readers. Pardon the really bad title. But I cannot help it. I just read the

, and this is what I read. Well, this is what she read and posted, and I read and I post here.

Excerpts:
<blockquote>
 <em>
  Kupi Luwak beans come from Indonesia and are harvested by civets, the indigenous wild cat. These clever felines sniff out the choicest berries, digest the flesh, and pass out the bean in the way that nature intended.
 </em>
 <em>
  The human element arrives in what must be the most highly specialised job on the planet - the tracking down of civet droppings and their careful rinsing to reveal the pristine and flavour-enhanced bean.
 </em>
