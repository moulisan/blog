            <h1>Service for a fee, in airlines.</h1>
            I just read a newspaper article (
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com">

) that airlines in the US are slowly charging fees for a lot of services that passengers used to take for granted. Some of the services include:
<ul>
 <li>
  Charging for checking your bag (some airlines used to charge only for second bag, more recently American Airlines has started charging for security-checking your first bag too.
 </li>
 <li>
  Charging for requesting an aisle seat/more leg room seats like the bulkhead/exit aisle seats
 </li>
 <li>
  Charging for meals on the flights
 </li>
 <li>
  Charging have increased for rescheduling tickets
 </li>
</ul>
Why ? The airlines say, the reason is the increasing price of oil. They have to meet their operating margins somehow ! Slowly airlines in India have started complaining about the price of oil as well. Will these charges come to India too? We already have charges for rescheduling and 'no-meals' on budget airlines. All we can do is to wait and watch.
