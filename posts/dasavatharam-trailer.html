<h1>Dasavatharam trailer</h1>
            The much awaited movie Dasavatharam from the ultimate actor, Padmashree Kamal Hassan. He has done 10 different roles in one film. Amazing. Here is what the Big B has to say about it:
<blockquote>
 Its Kamal Hassan’s film ‘Dasavataram’ and its music release and he has asked me over to attend the function to commemorate the occasion. There’s Jackie Chan, and the Chief Minister of TamilNadu and several colleagues of Kamal. Its a warm friendly event. The few minutes of the promo seen looks awesome. He has played 10 different roles in the film, and all seem so difficult t identify !! Marvelous !!
</blockquote>
And here is the trailer for your viewing pleasure :)
