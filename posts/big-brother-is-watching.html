Yup. Big brother is defenitely watching. It is very frightening to see what is happening in Britain. The Britons are being watched by the Government like never before. There is a camera for every 14 citizens apparently watching them 24/7.

The cameras are also talking now! Some of these cameras are being fitted with loudspeakers, so that the government can chastize wrong doers instantaneously. This is not a sci-fi movie.

Read the following bloomberg article.
