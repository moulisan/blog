            <h1>Hyperlocal for daily milk?</h1>
            The current proliferation of Hyperlocal is awesome. I love it because of at least 2 reasons:
<ol>
 <li>
  I get stuff from my local area - a lot of times I am used to getting stuff from nearby where I live. These goods may or may not be available elsewhere.
 </li>
 <li>
  I get it from the local grocers and shopkeepers - so they are not affected by the so-called "e-commerce boom". In fact hyperlocal enables ecommerce for these local guys who cannot afford to go and sell online.
 </li>
</ol>
Now, with that, out of my mind, let me get to a problem that every household faces. The problem of getting milk (and related items) every morning.

Daily home delivery of milk can be categorized into a couple of types:
<ol>
 <li>
  People who always order the same type of milk (full cream or toned or slim) and the same quantity every day.
 </li>
 <li>
  People who have coupons given by the milk guy for different quantities and types of milk. They drop these coupons in a bag outside the gate, and the milk guy delivers per the coupon dropped.
 </li>
</ol>
Even the first category guys have an on-demand requirement for other dairy and other bakery products such as curd, ghee, and bread (which, ofcourse has varieties - sandwich bread, milk bread, wheat, brown etc).

If you notice, one thing that is uniform across all the requirements is the fact that, in most times,
<strong>
 the requirement is remembered only at 10PM the previous night and is required the next day morning.
</strong>
This is the official pain-point that is to be addressed.

This is not an extensive mockup, but you get the drift.

Additional features could be:
<ul>
 <li>
  Location could either be the address that you signed up with, or can be configured using the GPS in your app.
 </li>
 <li>
  The Date screen could have a way by which you can add recurrence. This would make it slightly more complicated, but might be useful for those who order the same thing again and again.
 </li>
</ul>
For best ease of use, I would recommend an online wallet. The delivery is most likely going to be very early hours in the morning, and hence could be cumbersome for COD.
<strong>
 Need for a new special logistic solution
</strong>
The one thing different about the logistics of this delivery problem is that, in most cases, the delivery would need to be drop into a bag/basket tied on the gate and leave. If the delivery is going to be at 5AM, this would probably need to be the case. This goes against the traditional delivery logistics of getting an ack from the customer.

This could be potentially be solved using:
<strong>
 Trust
</strong>
method. The customer trusts the hyper local delivery guy completely that he would delivery what he had asked for. He would just get an SMS or a push notification that the goods have been delivered.
<strong>
 Proof
</strong>
method: The delivery guy has some kind of a proof method that he
<strong>
 did
</strong>
deliver the goods at the appropriate time. Perhaps he could place the goods in the appropriate location, click a snap with his logistics app which would imprint date/time on the snap and send it to you as part of push notification. More sophisticated RFID technologies could also perhaps be used - but I cannot think of any at the moment.

Well, @grofers, @amazonIN are you listening? Can we see this happening any time soon?
