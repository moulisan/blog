 Turn your computer OFF !
 <br/>
 Yes. I mean it. LifeDev has a beautiful post on how he did a 5 day PM Computer Fast. Read Fast as in abstinence (not as in Fast and Furious).
 <br/>
 For 5 days, he turned off his computer in the evening 6PM for the evening. He switched it on only the next day morning. I think this is good advise.
 <br/>
 He talks about the benefits of this in this nice post of his, the crux of it being:
</p>
<blockquote>
 <p>
  Essentially, your mind will focus more if it knows that it only can work on something for X hours. When it knows that it doesn't have the luxury of slacking off, it kicks it into the next gear and amazing results follow.
  <p>
   The same is true with my study. When I knew that the computer was going to be turned off at the same time every day, my productivity soared to new heights. Now that I only had a static, limited amount of time, I had to squeeze the most out of it. I had to plan, and only work on the most important things that
   <em>
    had
   </em>
   to be done that day.
  </p>
 </p>
</blockquote>

 This brought a smile to my face, because yesterday I did the same thing, and found it awesome, and was telling my wife about it. Infact, I was telling her that I think I should be doing this more often. I came home, and did not even take the laptop out (not even to check email). Usually I pop out the laptop to check email, and then I figure, I will post something in my blog, then I will meander to lifehacker, and then maybe feel guilty and code a little bit. This is what happens.
