<h1>Infinite Vision - The Story of Aravind Hospitals</h1>
            https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA5Dzlf7JEE

If you have not seen this short film, you should see it. This is the story of grit, determination, and a vision of a man, who despite his humble beginnings and his eventual roaring success, never lost his humility and his roots.

Blurb (in the youtube page):
<blockquote>
 An eye clinic with 11 beds. A country with 12 million blind. ...and one doctor dedicated to a beautiful dream.

Infinite Vision is the story of Dr. V, the legendary eye surgeon from South India who made it his mission to restore sight to the blind and whose work has resulted in one of the world's most extraordinary models of service delivery.

This film traces the inspiring life journey of a visionary dedicated to serving humanity, outlines the evolution of the Aravind model of eye care and affords glimpses into the spirituality that has guided both for over fifty years in service for sight.

"If you can't pay them you don't have to. If you can't come to them they'll come to you. Each year they bring light to millions of lives. Their services are world-class, but the spirit that drives them is one of a kind..."
