<h1>The Argumentative Follower (Vanthondan) – Part 3</h1>
<strong>
 Story so far:
</strong>
<em>
 Nambi Arooran of Thirunaavalur had almost gotten married. Lord Shiva in the guise of an old Brahmin comes and stops the marriage, and reminds him of his duties to be fulfilled on earth.
</em>

<br/>
Nambi thought back to his time in Kailasa.
<p>
<em>
 Lord Shiva was once admiring his own beauty on a mirror. He was so pleased at his own beauty, that, without realizing what he said, he said - "Sundaraaa vaa" (Come here, my beautiful one). The powers that Shiva had, his reflection stepped out as a person from the mirror. From that day on, Sundarar had become a constant companion and servant of the Lord (anukka thondan).
</em>
<p>
<em>
 On a fine summery morning, he was out plucking flowers for the Lord, he happened to see two maidens (Kamalini and Anindhithai) also in the garden. They were maidens of the Supreme Goddess Parvathi. In a spontaneous minute of love, he fell for both of their beauties. Lord Shiva got to know and did not approve.
</em>
<p>
<em>
 "There is a time and place for everything, and this is not it. You would need to go down to earth for this and finish what you started. You will enjoy your time with these two maidens, who will also descend to earth with you. I also want you to go to the Southern part of India, and sing about me. "
</em>
<p>
<em>
 Sundarar had realized his mistake and was ready to accept the punishment, but he made on request of the Lord - to come and remind him of this very moment, in case he got lost in the the pleasures of earthly living.
</em>
<p>
All these thoughts came flooding in as he stood in front of the blinding light, now feeling thankful that the Lord had come and reminded him of his past.
<p>
But, I do not know how to sing, or compose, or any of that, my Lord, How am I supposed to sing about you?
<p>
The Lord still loved him very dearly. He said, "Talk to me, swear at me, admonish me, like you just did a few hours ago. Remember you called me a senile old fool. It will still sound like music to my ears."
<p>
Lord Shiva also added - you will always be my Sundarar, my beautiful self. So I do not want you to renounce anything. I want you to always dress up like what you are now - in true wedding dress (kalyaana kolam). You will also be called Van thondan - the argumentative follower. And he vanished.
<p>
Over the course of the next 2 years, he meets Anindithai and Kamilini as Paravai Naachiyar (from Tiruvaaroor) and Sangili Naachiyar (from Thiruvatriyoor). And in these 2 years, he makes dozens of temple tours, singing on Lord Shiva, as he moved from temple to temple. Anecdotes abound on how the friendship of the Lord and Sundarar are played out. The Lord pulls out all stops to keep Sundarar, his friend, happy. Sundarar on the other hand, continues to admonish the Lord, never being satisfied with what he is given.
<p>
A peculiar friendship based devotion plays out in this Nayanmaars life. The story is meant to personify how devotion to God should not be of fear, but of trust and respect.
