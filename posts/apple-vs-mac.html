   The Forbidden Fruit

  <strong>
   Client:
  </strong>
  Hey, just one final question before I send the deposit. Do you use a PC or a MAC?
  <strong>
   Me:
  </strong>
  I use a MAC.
  <strong>
   Client:
  </strong>
  That is a problem. Do you have access to a PC? I am not a supporter of Apple products.
  <strong>
   Me:
  </strong>
  No, I don’t have access to a PC, but this will have little to no effect on the work itself.
  <strong>
   Client:
  </strong>
  I am a Christian and Apple products are sinful, I do not want our website to be created by a product made by this corrupt group. You need only look at their logo, an apple with a bite taken from it. Do you not know the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden? If I allowed you to create my website on a MAC I would be just like Adam, taking a bite of the forbidden fruit.
  <strong>

  “Take my advise, destroy your mac and repent for when judgement day comes. It shall be you who is cast to hell for your sins.”
