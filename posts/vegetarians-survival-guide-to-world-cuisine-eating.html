            <h1>Vegetarian's Survival Guide to World Cuisine Eating</h1>
            Whether you are traveling the world (on leisure or business), or are being adventurous and trying out an international cuisine restaurant in India, this article helps you eat without worries.

An excerpt:
<blockquote>
 <strong>
  Asian
 </strong>
 The relative absence of dairy makes it easy to eat vegan at an Asian restaurant. Order steamed vegetables, stir-fried tofu, lo mein, brown rice or any other meatless offering at a Chinese place. Go for miso soup and a vegetable sushi roll if you’re eating a Japanese meal. Thai, Vietnamese and Korean restaurants usually offer multiple vegetarian options on their menus as well.
 <em>
  Strict vegans:
 </em>
 Always ask to make sure your meal won’t contain any fish sauce or stock.
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Barbecue
  </strong>
 </h3>
 Although it seems like this category would be the toughest one of all, it’s probably the simplest—just go for the side dishes! Build a “sampler platter” of sides like grilled corn or asparagus (hold the butter), a dinner roll or two, steamed broccoli, a baked sweet potato with cinnamon sugar, or even steak fries.
 <em>
  Strict vegans:
 </em>
 Ask whether your veggies can be cooked on a separate grill or otherwise apart from where the meat is cooked.
 <h3>
  <strong>
   Breakfast &amp; Brunch
  </strong>
 </h3>
 Whether you find yourself at a Denny’s or at a fancy-schmancy brunch spot, there are lots of options when it comes to breakfast food. Fresh fruit, oatmeal, hash browns with ketchup, granola, bagels and toast with jam are a few great ones.
 <em>
  Strict vegans:
 </em>
 Request that your oatmeal be prepared with water instead of milk, and always remind your server you don’t want butter on your toast.
</blockquote>
The other cuisines covered are Indian, Italian, Mexican, Middle Eastern, and Pizza.
