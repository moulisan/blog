 Some time back, in an informational conversation with a colleague, I was asked - "How is the culture there?" I had to prefix my conversation with a - "this might not be the answer you were expecting." I am paraphrasing my conversation below.
 <br/>
<br/>
 I believe culture is something that you bring to the room. Depending on existing culture, your power equation, and a few other scenario specifics, it might take a longer time or not.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Think about it. What is culture? It is how you would like to 'feel' when working/interacting with others (who are also working alongside you). Culture could be truthfulness. Culture could be being warm/kind. Culture could be about a helping nature. Culture could be performance based. Culture could be hustling. Culture could be aggressive.
 <br/>
<br/>
 You could either adjust to the culture, adapt to the culture, contribute to the culture, or decide to change the culture. Again, your mileage and scenario may vary.
 <br/>
<br/>
 If you are a strong personality, and in a position of power, you could bring your culture to your surroundings quickly. This could be incremental (contribute) or change it completely. If you are not that strong a personality, but in a position of power, and there exists a decent culture, you would probably adjust or adapt to the culture. If you are a strong personality and do not have that much power, you can still contribute / effect, but it takes time. You model behaviors that you want people to emulate. And in the last combination of not too strong personality and no power, you eventually adjust or adapt.
 <br/>
<br/>
 Coming to the original question. If you are someone who cares so much about culture that you ask about it, in an informational, I would assume you would want to contribute / effect change to what you would enjoy.
 <br/>
<br/>
 PS: None of this happens in short periods of time. Building a culture takes time. It involves moulding human behavior.
