            <h1>Happy Tamil New Year</h1>
            Despite the government ruling in TamilNadu that today is not the new year, I (and countless other Tamil folks) will celebrate New Years day today.

  Happy Tamil New Years Day

 Mr K needs to realize, he cannot change tradition spanning hundreds and thousands of years. This date is most likely picked because of our superior astronomers/astrologers, who have written down an advanced solar calendar. Guess what, some smart folks in other parts of the country celebrate new year today as well -- the Bengali's have their new year today. It is scientific Mr Chief Minister, and not a whim of a political party to change these.
