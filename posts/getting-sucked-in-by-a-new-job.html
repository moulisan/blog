            <h1>Getting sucked in by a new job</h1>
            Fast Company has an amazing article titled "Thrown into the Deep end". This is about an Internet company guy, decides to leave and join his competitor as CEO, when his older company had been acquired by Google and shelved. The article is not about what he was before and after. The article is about how he got sucked into the new job, how he felt like having been thrown into the deep end of an olympic sized swimming pool in the middle of winter ! Good read.
