            An apparently rare occasion caught on film.

 Shown in the foreground is Space Shuttle
 <em>
  Atlantis
 </em>
 on Launch Pad A. The shuttle in the background is
 <em>
  Endeavour
 </em>
 , on Launch Pad B. Currently, both shuttles are locked and loaded for launch, should something go wrong up in space with the October 11
 <em>
  Atlantis
 </em>
 mission. As Tom explains over at his
 <a href="http://tomsastroblog.com/?p=1969">

 , having two shuttles on the pad at the same time is rare, but it is not a cause for concern.  	 					 When the ISS is not available for rescue purposes, as it might not be for this mission, a second shuttle is made ready for a quick launch. What is sobering, however, is this image is potentially the last of its kind. The space shuttle program is scheduled for retirement in 2010, leaving little chance for similar shuttle family photos in the future.
