 Nope. I am not talking about any address book software here. I just happened to see my sister's phone/address book lying on my desk (she is visiting us this month). I noticed that she has all her contacts pencilled in, in the book. I thought about it for a bit, and the bulb glowed on my head. Most often, I have seen people getting dis-illusioned by phone/address books mainly because, as people keep changing their contacts, the address book degenerates. You scratch out a number, write it below it. You scratch the whole entry sometimes. It becomes a mess after a very short time.

   If you pencil in an address book contact, when somebody's contacts changes, you can erase it and modify the contact,Â without much of a mess !
