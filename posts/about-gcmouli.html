<h1>About gcmouli</h1>
            This blog was started in blogger. I have been blogging about software, technology and personal productivity for a few years now. I recently shifted to wordpress, because of some neat features that Blogger did not have. Since then, blogger also has been on the move, and gotten fancier, and nicer. Over the years, I moved to a self-hosted wordpress blog. And now (December of 2011), I feel I want to focus back on content, and moved back to wordpress.com hosted blog.

About me : I am a software engineer who loves engineering management (wierd combo, I know!). I did my Phd in the US of A (sunny florida) in Computer Engineering. I lived in Noida (near Delhi) for a while, coding for a large EDA (electronic design automation) company. Over time, I started managing a small group, and got interested in management too. After about 4 years into the job, I finally thought, it was time, to move closer home to South India. I shifted to the software capital of India -
<em>
 Namma Bengaluru
</em>
. For a brief period of 6 months, I worked as a product specialist for a small startup company. I then joined a company which was a medium sized company, and we  got bought by a giant (in relative terms to the EDA industry), which is a competitor to my first company in Noida. Oh well. It is a small world after all. I now manage a small group of super-energetic induviduals ; and also do some amount of coding myself as well. All in all a lot of fun.

I thought I was having fun, when suddenly a totally different opportunity stared me in the face - a Program Management position at Microsoft. I moved to Hyderabad for a year (at that time, MS presence in Bangalore was very small). As of December 2011, I am back in *sigh with relief* Namma Bengaluru - still doing Program Management at Microsoft. Having even more fun now.

Still in the quest of fun, an awesome opportunity presented itself in the EDA company I left. So I am back. Now in a challenging new role in the Software Engineering Team. Pursueing one of my passions -- to bring some software engineering order to the madness we call EDA. Trying to introduce a concept called Reusable components to product teams and attempt to reduce duplication of code and effort.

The above was written looong time back. I refreshed my career journey recently in 2023. You can read here -&gt;
