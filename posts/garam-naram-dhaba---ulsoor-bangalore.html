            <h1>Garam Naram Dhaba - Ulsoor Bangalore</h1>
            Have heard a lot about the Dhaba next to the Gurudwara in Ulsoor. So went there today. The name said 'Garam Naram Dhaba'. I have heard about it only as Bobby-da-dhaba. (Not sure ifÂ  they changed the name !). My review about the dhaba below:
<ul>
 <li>
  Decent Parathas - with the customary dollop of butter on top
 </li>
 <li>
  Rajma Chawal was so-so.
 </li>
 <li>
  Chilly Panner Veg was also so-so.
 </li>
 <li>
  Lassi was very diluted (compared to the lassi you get in North India)
 </li>
 <li>
  Ambience - it is inside a room - so not so dhaba-like. Furniture is very dhaba-like. Moulded tables and chairs.
 </li>
 <li>
  Service - relatively fast - but the starter and the food arrived at the same time.
 </li>
</ul>
