            <h1>Demo day at Shotang</h1>
            
<p> Earlier this month, we, at Shotang, held our first demo day. It was a Friday afternoon event on our terrace. We could not have had better weather that day. The intent of this event is to showcase the technology and the product that is being built to enable the first large scale retail distribution platform. This would hence enable all the functions of the Shotang family to literally play with the product and gain a deeper understanding.

This was driven by the awesome product team at Shotang, ably supported by the equally awesome tech team. The product team coined a name for the demo day as well – Shotgun. We ran with a Wild West theme through the communications.
</p>
<p>
This being the first demo day, the event focused on the journey of an order on the Shotang platform. We wanted everyone to experience the full flow - from the retailer placing an order through the Shotang retailer app, to how it flows through the seller dashboard ecosystem, and the falcon logistics apps, which powers our pickers and the delivery executives.

We had set up POD stations on the terrace – one each for the retailer experience, seller experience, and the logistics platform. Engineers and PMs manned these booths and explained the flows with pride. There was a complete test bed that had been created on a test city, where guests could place orders, and trace their order through the entire platform.

It so happens that in a company such as Shotang, day to day agility forces each function in the company to focus deeply on their own domains. For example, the corporate finance team spends its waking days poring over the sales and spends numbers, but often do not get enough visibility into the actual product. Similarly for other teams such as our customer delight team, our commercial finance team, alliances team, and so on.
</p>

<strong>
 What did we get out of this?
</strong>
<ul>
 <li>
  Singular pride for each PM and engineer who showcased the products that they develop. You should have seen the energy on the floor.
 </li>
 <li>
  Zonal leaders (P&amp;L owners) from each of the 7 cities that we are live in, got insights into what is the current state of product and tech, and what is in store for the future.
 </li>
 <li>
  Greater visibility on the amount of tech that goes in to developing our platform
 </li>
 <li>
  Increased empathy for our end customer and what she goes through.
 </li>
 <li>
  So much feedback that came in from non-tech folks on improvements that could be made with respect to user interfaces.
 </li>
</ul>
<strong>
 Moving forward:
</strong>
We intend to have a Shotgun event every month. Product and tech developments since the previous month would be demonstrated. We would sync the event to the monthly planning meeting of the Zonal managers. We anticipate that the local field leaders and the zonal leaders would take back to their respective field teams, the latest developments and future plans.

At the end of the day, It is also a fun event, where we celebrate all the hard work that has gone in, to do, what we all love doing – ship!
