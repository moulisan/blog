            Mumbai businessman rethinks the pizza box. Rather than thinking outside the box, he rethought the box. Apparently the reason why Pizzas arrive soggy is because, they dont have a way by which the steam can be ventilated out. This box has been judged the worlds best pizza box by the renowned Scott Wiener (author of a book called Viva La Pizza - The Art of the Pizza box).

It's the biggest challenge of pizza box designers to design something that retains heat without trapping steam and I think this box has just achieved that" - said Scott.
