<h1>Day 5 - Madras Music Season - OS Arun/Priya Sisters</h1>
<p>
 OS Arun (stayed only for half concert). Concert was at Bharath Kalachar. Got very bad seats. The burnt oil smell (or should I say stink!) from the canteen wafted too strongly for comfort. Disgusting, and distracting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Ok crowd.
 </li>
<li>
  Ghana ragam was Kalyani. He was experimenting something - mixed in a few other ragams. In my humble opinion, they did not mix well.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
 Priya Sisters. Concert was at Parthasarathy swamy Sabha - Bheemasena Garden Street - off Luz.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  Concert was awesome. Very fast paced. Good selection of songs.
 </li>
<li>
  The elder sister had a bad throat, and there were some times, when she struggled. But other than those times, the concert was very enjoyable.
 </li>
<li>
  Sujanajeevana (Kamas) and Soundararajam (brindavana saranga) was highly enjoyable.
 </li>
<li>
  The next day was Arudra Dharshanam - so they sang a kriti on Mylai Kapaleeswarar (Nambi kettavar evvarum illai) - Hindolam - one of my favourite raagams.
 </li>
<li>
  For the ghana ragam - it was Mohana Rama (Mohanam) - very well sung. A long time, since I heard Mohanam being picked as a ghana ragam.
 </li>
<li>
  Then they shifted into bhajanai mode (for the mylapore maami's who were the overwhelming majority in the crowd - I even wondered if the entire sanskrit college crossed the road and came to the concert). A neat fast paced kriti - Matsya Kurma Varaha was sung to set the stage.
 </li>
<li>
  Sree Chakra Raja Simhasaneswari was beautiful. One of my favourite songs as well. But then, the master of this song - Maharajapuram Santhanam - is no more!
 </li>
<li>
  Jo acchuthananda (nilambari) - put us all into a somniferous state - with the entire mami population - swaying.
 </li>
<li>
  There was also a nice Kabir bhajan - chadhariya - fast paced and nice.
 </li>
<li>
  All in all, a very entertaining concert.
 </li>
<li>
  Canteen was also good - had a plate of bonda - very tasty.
 </li>
