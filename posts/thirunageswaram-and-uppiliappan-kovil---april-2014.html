            <h1>Thirunageswaram and Uppiliappan Kovil - April 2014</h1>
            The second day in the Jilla, we did a short visit with the family to Uppilliappan and adjoining Thirunageswaram. There was not much of a rush at Uppilliappan kovil.
            <p>
             One good thing about this temple is the massive size of the Perumal and the unobstructed view you can get of the Diety from afar.<p>

By the time, we got to Thirunageswaram, the sun was at its peak - fuming at 40 Deg Cel. Having toasted our feet effectively by running on the solid granite pathway to the temple, we found the situation not very surprising.
<p>
The main Shivasthalam - Naganatha Swamy had absolutely no crowd. The full crowd was only at the Raahu deity.

Had a good dharshan and returned back to Kumbakonam. A quick 2 hour trip for both temples together.
