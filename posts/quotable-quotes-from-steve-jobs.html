            Yes, there are many many more. But a couple that I came across today morning, that are worth mentioning.
<blockquote>
 <strong>
  On focus groups?
 </strong>
 "It’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”

"You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new."
 <strong>
  On creativity
 </strong>
 “Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.
 <strong>
  On how innovation really happens
 </strong>
 “But innovation comes from people meeting up in the hallways or calling each other at 10:30 at night with a new idea, or because they realized something that shoots holes in how we’ve been thinking about a problem. It’s ad hoc meetings of six people called by someone who thinks he has figured out the coolest new thing ever and who wants to know what other people think of his idea."
 <strong>
  On designing products
 </strong>
 “Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it’s really how it works... To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it’s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don’t take the time to do that."
</blockquote>
And ofcourse, the quote from his famous Stanford Commencement Speech -
<blockquote>
 <em>
  <strong>
   “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
  </strong>
 </em>
