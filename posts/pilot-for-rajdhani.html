 East Central Railway already saw 18 attacks in the last one year,including the derailment of 10 coaches of the Delhibound Rajdhani express,between Gaya and Mughalsarai in Bihar.This has prompted the railways to run pilot engines ahead of Rajdhani express trains.As many as eight Rajdhani trains daily pass through this stretch.
