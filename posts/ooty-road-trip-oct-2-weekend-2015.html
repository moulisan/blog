 General trip notes:

<div class="storify">

<ul>
 <li class="storify">
  Mostly the roads were good - except for a short stretch from Mysore to Nanjangud - where there is road widening that is happening. Once this is finished, the road should be fully done.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  I took the Masinagudi route to/from Ooty - this is the 36 hairpin bend short route. The road in this stretch is also awesome.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  The road inside the Bandipur sanctuary has been freshly laid and is really good.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  On our way to Ooty, we passed by the Bandipur area around 6PM. Looks like this is a great time to spot animals. Spotted hordes of bison, deer, and peacock.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  On our way back, the traffic was horrendous. All of Bangalore was returning from the long weekend.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  Do not miss the wood fired pizza at Nahar Side walk cafe. Their multi-cuisine restaurant - Chandan - is also pretty good. Both are pure vegetarian.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  The Sterling Elk Hill property has undergone massive renovation and looks super posh inside. They are adding more rooms as well.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  On the way back, if you want to fill gas, there is a bunk, right at the beginning of the Mysore road (from Ooty).
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  If you want to avoid the maddening crowds of Ooty, and want a relaxing drive, drive down the road towards Kundha/Upper Bhavani. The Emerald lake is just an awesome vista point.
 </li>
 <li class="storify">
  If you want to have lunch in Mysore, but do not want to go into the city, there is a Kamat Madhuvan, just near the Mysore bypass.
 </li>
</ul>
