For once I agree with the government. Oh my God, it has been a long time since I said that.

I first read this paragraph:
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
I was like, Oh no, not another beurocrat making a bad decision. Then came the surprise:
<blockquote>
 . "We cannot visualise a situation for decades when we can go beyond the pilot stage. We need classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools," said Banerjee.
</blockquote>
I cannot agree more on this. Hat tip to Mr. Banerjee.
