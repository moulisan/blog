            <h1>10 things you should never put in your resume</h1>
            Disclaimer: This list applies only to resumes that you send to technology companies.
<ol>
 <li>
  No Superlative adjectives about your capabilities. No "superior knowledge of OOD", or "exemplary customer orientation". This sets a very high expectation, and even a very small flaw in your interview or phone screen, can make your resume look inaccurate.
 </li>
 <li>
  Do not convert educational grading systems. If you are in India, and your university marks were in %, put it that way. No need to convert to 4.0 system. If you were in IIT, there is no need to convert to a percentile system. You are just confusing the reader.
 </li>
 <li>
  Do not put in qualities that you are expected to have as part of any job. Example - "Been an integral part of every team I have been in." This is understood.
 </li>
 <li>
  No jargon and defenitely no abbreviations. I do not know what SCCM protocol is, if I am not in the same industry.
 </li>
 <li>
  Defenitely no fluff. Put in only things that you know. If you have have cursory knowledge say so. I actually appreciate that more. I like resumes which say "Expert knowledge in foo; working knowledge of foo2; and cursory knowledge of foo3." This makes me believe in you.
 </li>
 <li>
  Do not make me search for vital information. The first page should have everything that I need to know. If I am interested, I would need to flip the page.
 </li>
 <li>
  Please dont end the resume with Date of birth, Marital Status, Mother Tongue, and finally a statement stating all of the above is true to the best of your knowledge. This may be required for a Govt job, but not in an IT company.
 </li>
 <li>
  No photos. No clipart. No images.
 </li>
 <li>
  Do not put in too many fancy fonts. I like an uniform font through the resume. And no fancy fonts. Plain Arial, Times New Roman, Calibri/Cambria. Font size atleast 10 point.
 </li>
 <li>
  No references to internal technology and algorithms. This makes me wary of how well you respect your Intellectual Property of your current company. If you are loose there, so will you be in my company if I hire you.
 </li>
</ol>
