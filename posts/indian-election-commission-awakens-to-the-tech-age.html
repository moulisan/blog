            <h1>Indian Election Commission awakens to the tech age</h1>
            Last week, when I was travelling on the bus to work, I happened to notice the following news items.
<ul>
 <li>
  BJP opens its website.
  <em>
   It is a pretty crappily designed site - atleast when viewed in Firefox. Go see for yourself.
   <a href="http://www.bjp.org">
    (www.bjp.org)
   </a>
  </em>
 </li>
 <li>
  Election Commission considers placing of e-ads (ads in websites/popups etc) as election propaganda material, and costs towards placing these should be accounted for.
 </li>
 <li>
  There will be a timing restriction on election propaganda SMS's.
 </li>
</ul>
It is heartening to see, that the EC, and some of the parties are waking up to the tech-age ... atlast.
