 Bob Walsh from to-done.com, has a nice piece on self-evaluating yourself at periodic intervals to make sure you are indeed being productive.The activity is fairly simple. He suggests a simple excel sheet printed out or a hand-drawn grid. There are two aspects to this sheet. (1) List about 10 activities that you typically do during your day (2) A grid showing your typical work hours divided into 15 minute intervals. Keith reasons out - why 15 min intervals. 5 mins is too small, but 1 hour is too large for our distraction filled universe. Do this for 3-4 days, and you will know if you are indeed being productive.
