            I always appreciate brashness in business. Thats how business get built. The guts, the mental strength, and the determination to standup against established players - thats what I am talking about.

Anil noodles: It requires guts to stand up and make noodles in a market, where people call noodles as 'maggi'. In most parts of India, people refer to noodles as Maggi. So entrenched is maggi noodles. And the remaining of India knows one more brand - Top Ramen which is a world player. In this world of noodles, one company stands up and advertises a brand named as Anil Noodles - now that is guts. I do not know how it tastes, or how well they are doing, but their guts must defintely be appreciated.
