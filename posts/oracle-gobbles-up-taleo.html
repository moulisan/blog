            <h1>Oracle gobbles up Taleo</h1>
            Oracle buys Taleo for $1.9 billion. Wow. I have seen Taleo been used by quite a few Blue Chip companies for their resume/candidate management needs. Consolidation seems to be in-thing now. SAP just bought SuccessFactors. I see this inline with a couple of strong beliefs of mine --
<ul>
 <li>
  The world is moving from 'Generalized software frameworks' to a 'solution based system'. From configurable SAP based ERP systems to a tailormade (customizable) employee management system. From a generalized Oracle database hosting your jobs and resume data to a more-rounded Recruitment system.
 </li>
 <li>
  The generalized software frameworks would not go away, but would become moreÂ  B2B (Business2Business). Startups would consume these to build powerful user-oriented systems
 </li>
 <li>
  Innovation would be driven by novel use of these user-oriented systems and mash-ups rather than fundamental shifts in technology. The latter would exist, but would not be the news-breakers of tomorrow. They would just bring cheer to the innovators, and make them innovate more.
 </li>
</ul>
