            Wow. Google never ceases to amaze me. Yes, I know, I have this as my starting line in multiple blog posts until now. But thats how it is. Now, if you get an email in one language, you can press the "Translate to English" button, and lo ! behold ! your email in your language. (You have to enable the google labs feature for translation though). How cool is that ! I really do agree with their 'claim' to better world integration now. Multiple people speaking to each other in their own language, and yet, everyone understanding each other. Isnt that wonderful. (You cannot even do that in real life speech conversations!).
