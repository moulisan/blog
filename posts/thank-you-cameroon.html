<h1>Thank you Cameroon</h1>
            For those who are wondering, what/who/where is Cameroon? It is a small country in central/western africa. [

Ok why I am thanking Cameroon? I should actually thank Google too. Half the time, my fingers work faster than my brain, while typing. (My dad is always onto me for this -- his theory is that I use the backspace key twice as much as the other keys). But back to Cameroon, there are quite a few times, when I want to google.com and my fingers fly and type google.cm (without the 'o') and hit enter. Until recently, I got a 404 fail, but now, voila, Google has a google.cm domain - for their Cameroon users. Whooopie.
