            What do these have in common? All part of a bus ride back home from ITPL :)

The shifted backside was not incurred by me, because of the bad road - but happened to be a sign put up by a shopkeeper to indicate that he has vacated his older shop facing the road, and moved to a shop at the back.

The imported crackery was not any drug case busted, but happened to be a sale on airport road, selling plates, spoons and other dinner sets. (I think the owner meant crockery!)

And as for  '
<em>
 Brocheva
</em>
', the driver had a small AM radio and a speaker above his head, which he had tuned to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio">
 All India Radio Vividh Bharathi
</a>
. It has been so long since I listened to this. And yesterday, it was Unni Krishnan crooning to
<em>
 Brocheva
</em>
in
<em>
 Kamas
</em>
, and
<em>
 Paluke Bangara mayena
</em>
in
<em>
 Ananda Bhairavi
</em>
. The driver was fully into the music. He was tapping his foot, putting thalam on the steering wheel, and was totally enjoying a full-blown music sabha experience. Only that, his driving speed or his rashness did not reduce, because of the mellifluous music.

Incidentally, Paluke is a briilliantly addictive song. I am still humming it.
