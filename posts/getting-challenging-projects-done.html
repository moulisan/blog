            All of us have been in these situations, where we have fought for a challenging project to be assigned to us. Now, we have it for ourselves. Hmm. Now what? How do we start?

The essence of the article is:
<ol>
 <blockquote>
  <li>
   Start small
  </li>
  <li>
   Make small timelines
  </li>
  <li>
   Frequently review the details
  </li>
  <li>
   Don’t sweat the details… yet.
  </li>
  <li>
   Think outside the box
  </li>
  <li>
   Think INSIDE the box
  </li>
  <li>
   Ask advice
  </li>
 </blockquote>
</ol>
Each one of these bullets is important - ones that we often tend to ignore in high-pressure situations.
