            <h1>Bangalore Traffic Signage</h1>
            Recently, I have started seeing the Bangalore Traffic Police put up signage in several places like this:

 <img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1616" height="332" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sign11.jpg" title="sign1" width="343"/>
</a>
But Bangalore traffic is neither linear nor discrete, like what is assumed in the above pic. Sshould not the signage read more like this:

 <img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1617" height="352" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/sign21.jpg" title="sign2" width="513"/>
</a>
<div id="_mcePaste">
 Jokes apart,
 <strong>
  Bangalore - please follow traffic rules and drive safe
 </strong>
 . Yesterday morning, there was an accident right outside the gates of my office on Old Madras Road, where a two wheeler was run over by a water tanker lorry. The two wheeler driver died on the spot. My heart goes out to the family of the driver. They probably were just expecting the guy to go to office and return in the evening. If only, each of us, took our own driving into our hands, and driving sanely, Bangalore traffic chaos would reduce by magnitudes.
