            <h1>Save your eyes</h1>
            A great list of simple things that you can do to save your eyes from degeneration due to age (yeah yeah, taking care of them now, saves them later!). I loved this list because, most of the dietary options are vegetarian - and I am a strict vegetarian. Some salient points:
<ol>
 <li>
  Eat spinach twice a week
 </li>
 <li>
  Blueberries and yogurt
 </li>
 <li>
  Red onions are better than yellow onions
 </li>
 <li>
  Aim your car AC vents at your feet and not at your eyes. Dried up eyes are bad.
 </li>
 <li>
  Sweet potatoes are very good
 </li>
 <li>
  Wear sunglasses and a broad brimmed hat to avoid direct exposure to sunlight
 </li>
 <li>
  Beet is very good for the eyes.
 </li>
</ol>
