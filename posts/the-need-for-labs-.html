It is becoming increasingly evident that companies should be establishing labs inside their entities, for exploring new deep tech independently.
<ul>
 <li>
  The labs should have the autonomy to go far-out into futuristic new deep tech without having to worry about current limitations.
 </li>
 <li>
  The research function should be independent and should encourage creativity.
 </li>
 <li>
  To a large extent the labs work should not have time pressures.
 </li>
 <li>
  Productising these research ideas would be the key to differentiating the companies offerings in this hyper-competitive space.
 </li>
 <li>
  These labs should not be led by architects or EMs. They should be led by people who have experience in doing research, preferably PhD.
 </li>
 <li>
  Research rigour is important.
 </li>
</ul>
Some companies have been doing this for a very long time - Mercedes, Airbus, Sabre etc. Ixigo Kitchen Sink is a classic example from a few years ago. I am hearing of more newer companies starting to do this - Amadeus Labs, Rivigo labs etc.

It would be refreshing to see this happening in all the unicorns. For instance, I would imagine Swiggy would benefit immensely -- so much funky stuff can be done on IoT, route planning, kitchen optimization etc. Similarly Go-MMT does a lot of research along with the day-to-day work. I believe that this is not the right approach. You should separate these two out - for best optimality. Else, engineers and PMs are permanently at a conundrum to see which is more important - long term research drivers or short term revenue drivers.

What do you guys think?
