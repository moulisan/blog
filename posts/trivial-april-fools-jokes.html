<h1>Trivial April Fools Jokes</h1>
            It has now come to the point where companies try and pull a slow one (yeah, its not even fast these days) on April Fools day. The jokes are lame and silly. On first glance, it is obvious that it is a prank.
<ul>
<li>
  Google Blue. Really? A first look at the video instantly tells you its a prank.
 </li>
<li>
  Youtube going down. Really? Just a few days/weeks ago, there was a revenue report, which reported it was doing quite well.
 </li>
<li>
  Adobe releasing a new font called Blank, which users cant see. Really?
 </li>
</ul>
Guys, if you dont have any thing to fool people, just skip this year. This is just silly.
