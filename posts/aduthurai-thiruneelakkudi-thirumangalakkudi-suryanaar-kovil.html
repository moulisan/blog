            <h1>Aduthurai, Thiruneelakkudi, Thirumangalakkudi, Suryanaar Kovil</h1>
            First day in the jilla itself saw wheels sprouting below my feet :). Had planned the first three temples from Bangalore itself.
<strong>
 Aduthurai
</strong>
is hardly a 15-20 minute drive from Kumbakonam. Most people do not even know there is a famous Shivan temple here. This temple is of the Ramayana ages, where Sugriva worshipped the Shiva lingam. The original name of this temple town is "Ten-Kurangu-aduthurai". The temple was renovated and rebuilt by funds from Sembiyan Maa Devi - Raja Raja Chozhan's grandmother.

 In the days of the Chozha period,

<i>
 Ladies of the royal family also took active interest in social constructions like temples, hospitals etc.
</i>
As expected, the grand total of people in the temple was 2 - me and the Shiva Bhattar.

<strong>
 Thiruneelakkudi -
</strong>
This small temple town is about 4 km from Aduthurai on the road that connects the Kumbakonam-Mayavaram road to the Kumbakonam-Kariakal Road. You cannot miss this road. You can just ask for the Thiruneelakkudi road. Qaint little temple. The lad Markandeya clung to the Shiva lingam when Yama came to grab him. Shiva was upset and kicked Lord Yama away. Shiva then asked Markandeya to go to this place - Thiruneelakkudi and do penance. After a while, Lord Shiva gave Markandeya eternal life here. The temple pond is called Markandeya Theertham.

Thirumangalakkudi - is 2 km North of Aduthurai. Just ask for route to Suriyanaar Kovil. Just before you hit Suriyanaar kovil, you will hit a fork - you go left for Thirumangalakkudi and right for Suriyanaar Kovil. This temple is well frequented - partially because of a tradition of starting your Navagraha temple tour by first going to this temple. The Shivan is famous for reducing any mental stress. The bhattar also told me that, the Shiva lingam can absorb any number of litres of oil poured on it.

Also visited Suriyanaar kovil. Did not take any pictures there. The temple is a fully commerical temple now - catering the Navagraha tour circuit tourists only. There are two things that are unique about the architecture of this temple though. Suryan (Sun) is at the centre, and there are shrines for 8 planets all around the Sun. These guys knew their astronomy quite well. The other bigger thing is that, the temple is built such that, only on one specific day which is famous for the Surya God, the sun's rays fall directly on the deity.
