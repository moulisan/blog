            Super article on LinkedIn Pulse today. The story of a Chinese born man Lu Xu, who faked passports and identity documents for more than 500 times to write the GMAT exam on behalf of others (illegally). He got great scores obviously. He got paid a handsome amount from most folks for whom he faked, and he did it free for some friends to achieve their dreams. He was ofcourse caught and sentenced to jail for a few years. He comes out of Jail and then becomes a GMAT tutor. Wow.
