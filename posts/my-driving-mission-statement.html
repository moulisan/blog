 Since we need a mission statement for tasks/projects that we commonly do, I guess I came up with my own mission statement for my commute.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  <em>
   "I am not rash, nor am I fast, but I just cant stand idiots on the road. I just need to get past them, and I will do anything to do so."
  </em>
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 My commute takes me through 2 villages (typical Uttar Pradesh villages). And I get more than a fair share of irrational people (with suicidal driving tendencies) sharing the road with me, during my commute to and back from work.
</p>
<p>
 And on a related note, I still do not understand why they used to always establish export processing zones outside the city !
