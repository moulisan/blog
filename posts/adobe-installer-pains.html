            Wow. Derek Miller, in his blog just rants his heart out, at how bad his UI experience was, when, all he tried to do was to install Adobe Acrobat Reader. Wow. My slackened jaw has still not recovered.
<blockquote>
 Why, if I want to install Adobe Reader (which I don't, but I need to do it because on occasion Mac OS X Preview has trouble with a PDF file), should I download a program that runs an installer to install some software to download an updater than downloads more files to run an installer that installs software that is way too big and slow to start...
