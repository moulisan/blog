<h1>Exam Results Online</h1>
            Incredible, how India's IT infrastructure has advanced by leaps and bounds. Every state educational board exam result is available online (via NIC - the National Informatics Center). Yesterday my society supervisor came and asked me if I could check the result for two of his nephews. The CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) has been having the results online for a few years now. But, it was quite a surprise to me that, now almost every state has its results online too. For instance yesterday, all I had to do was to go upresults.nic.in (to get the Uttar Pradesh Class X results). Amazing. The interface is incredibly light - so that the servers can take the load and the page can load quickly. The page only has a box for roll number. You type in the roll number, and you get the students name (just to confirm, it is indeed the right marks you are looking at), and the score breakup in each subject.

There is also a top level results page
<a href="http://results.nic.in">
 results.nic.in
</a>
, from where you can jump to any state of your choice.
