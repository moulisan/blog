 Every one has heard of the saying - 'To each their own'. I beg to differ. In this age, people have choices. 'Own' is singular. People get to choose what they like 'best'. So I coined my own saying - To each their 'best'  :).Anyway, that is me trying to play the philosopher. Anyone wonder what secret does ultra-cool Gina Trapani of Lifehacker fame, employ for her daily productivity needs. What hi-fi or lo-fi system does she use ?

Very nicely written post which supports my philosophical rambling above. My favourite part of the post is:

   Taste-testing is easy. Committing to a tool is more difficult. With the daily onslaught of new and sexy apps out to help you get organized, it’s hard to settle on just one. Don’t get stuck in continual evaluation analysis paralysis, hopping from one solution or software package to another, relentlessly re-working your process for the sake of finding the perfect system. Don’t let Shiny New Thing seduce you. Stick to what works.
