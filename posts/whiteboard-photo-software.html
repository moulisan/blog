<h1>WhiteBoard Photo Software</h1>
            Just came across this software. Just amazing. Have you ever been in a situation (or situations) where you have just had an hour long discussion in front of a white board (and your company does not have one of those electronic white boards) - and you want the scribbles on the white board for later reference. Ok, if you are the geek that we all are, you would whip out your digital camera and take a snap. These do come out ok. But check out the following link. This is a software which will take in the digital snap, crop the white board, do color correction, keystone correction etc - and give you the output as if you were working on a white sheet of paper.

Check out the before-and-after link.
