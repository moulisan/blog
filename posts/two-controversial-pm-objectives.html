There are two slightly controversial topics that I hold dear to me, when I think of PM-ing.

(1) Stake holder management - internal and external. I have written about this extensively in the past. Some folks think that it is a project/program managers job. But I don't. I think it is an integral part of a product managers job. No one knows the bigger picture
<strong>
 and
</strong>
the granular details of the product than a PM. Getting every contributor and decision maker in the same page is super critical. Giving this job to a project manager is suicide. Absolutely lack of credibility will kill everything in sight. (I have nothing against project managers, but they are ninjas at managing the project as an entity, and not quite objectives and people).

(2)Â Data is everything in this new world. But ever so often, there is either too little data, or there is too much data. In both of these cases, it becomes incredibly hard to extricate inferences out of the data, leave alone insights. During these cases, it is the singular responsibility of the PM to work closely with leadership to suggest a solution based on "gut feel". The extensive involvement of the PM in the multiple facets of developing the product (no one else puts their fingers into so many facets as the PMs) makes the 'gut feel' more credible.
