A snippet from an article in linux.com:
<blockquote>
 Recently, I wrote a
 <a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/134049" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  review
 </a>
 of the note-taking application Tomboy. Though I find Tomboy exceptionally useful, I had a minor issue with the inability to create new notebooks from within a note. Within hours of the review appearing on Linux.com, Boyd Timothy, one of the app's developers mentioned in the article's comments that my idea had merit and said he would add the feature to an upcoming build. True to his word,
 <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/tomboy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">
  he did
 </a>
 . This is a shining example of one of the most valued yet sometimes overlooked features of open source software: it really
 <em>
  is
 </em>
 for the people, by the people.
