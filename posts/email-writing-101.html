Good post in the Blue Flavor Blog about the essentials of email writing. Good points made. The authors talks about how brevity is important, how subject lines decide whether the reader will read the email or not ; and how one should leave the reader with an easily respondable question.

I strongly agree with this. In most cases, I would strongly favor an email asking me something like -- "Do you agree with this ? " -- and I would embed my answer into the email. I would not like something like -- "What are your thoughts on this ?", or "Do you think this would work ? " . Both these require you to put effort into the email, the consequence of which is going to be just a decision. If there is more to be discussed, I would rather expect something like "If you have more thoughts, call me at xxx-xxx-xxxx".
