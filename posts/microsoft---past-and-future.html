            <h1>Microsoft - past and Future</h1>
            This morning, I was talking exactly the same thing with my boss on the hallway. MS should just concentrate on the cloud - the azure platform. Build the developer community for it. Make sure it delivers data and functionality to every connected device. Bring office and sharepoint as services to the world. To every connected device. That is the future.

And was I surprised to read a blog post by John @gruber Â on daringfireball.net today which pretty much ended on that same note. Very well written article I should say.
