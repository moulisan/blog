]. Wow indeed. We Indians, have been taking tiffin carriers for ages. Apparently American steel workers used to take such carriers but of steel. But now, lifehacker says the below:
<blockquote>
 If you're not content with smooshing all your

  food
 </a>
 into a mini-cooler or a brown bag, behold the stackable, food-separating, shiny awesomeness of a tiffin carrier lunchbox.

Tiffins—derived from the Indian word for snack—are the Indian equivalent of the iconic steel lunch boxes that mid-century working men in United States carried. Essentially a tiffin is a series of stacking containers and lids secured by a tension clip on the side.

But the dang-mother-of-all-gods-what-the-h*** moment is, when you read the below:
<blockquote>
 Prices range from $12-$25, depending on the number of tiers and size you select. The Tiffins are made from food-grade stainless steel, so they'll last you for a lifetime and provide endless easy conversation-starters at lunch tables.
</blockquote>
$25 for a tiffin box !!! Hmm, let me see, 25x50 (approx) = Rs. 1250.  You can get 5 tiffin boxes in India for that ! ROFL.
