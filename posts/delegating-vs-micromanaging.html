            <h1>Delegating vs MicroManaging</h1>
            Just read a great post by Steven Sinovsky in his "Learning by Shipping" blog, which he started, just after he left MS. This is one of his few rare concise posts. He has a ton of experience and fantastic in-depth into software management, but some of his posts just run too long. I liked this one.

The problem is clearly stated in the words of a first year MBA student:
<blockquote>
 <em>
  High-performing people generally want autonomy to get things done without anyone micromanaging them.  At the same time, as a midlevel manager, I’ve often had someone above me who’s holding me accountable for whatever my direct reports are working on.
 </em>
 <em>
  I’m struggling to find the right balance between giving people their autonomy while also asking sufficient questions to get the detail I need in order to feel comfortable with how things are going.
 </em>
</blockquote>
And Steve provides 5 tips to find the right balance between delegating vs micro-managing.
<ol>
 <li>
  <b>
   Delegate the problem, don’t solve it.
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Share experiences, don’t instruct.
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Listen to progress, don’t review it.
  </b>
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Provide feedback, don’t course correct
  </b>
  .
 </li>
 <li>
  <b>
   Communicate serendipitously, don’t impede progress.
  </b>
 </li>
</ol>
I mostly agree with all of them. My favourites (which I try and practice as much as possible) are (2) and (5). I am a big believer in Management by Walking Around (for middle managers atleast). It is so much more productive for the manager and the team.

Maybe sometime later, I will write up something myself on what I feel one can do to find the middle ground. But for now, you can read the full article
