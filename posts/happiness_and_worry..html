 The two conflicting words that make up the title coincidentally showed up on lifehack.org on the same day. Wow. There are two nice articles on "How and why you should be happy" and "How to stop worrying". I think these are important things that everyone should know.The first article (read
 <a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/9-tips-in-life-that-lead-to-happiness.html#more-612">
  here
 </a>
 ) talks about why you should spend some time and analyze what makes you happy. And then work towards getting into these situations or achieving such things that will make you happy. One good tip which I strongly agree with, is to surround yourself with happy people. Good read.

The second article (read
 <a href="http://www.anxietyculture.com/worry.htm">
  here
 </a>
 ) is from Anxiety Culture. Very nicely written piece on why one should not worry. Nice intro.

  We're raised to worry                                          and aren't considered "grown up"                                          until we perfect the art. Teenagers are                                          told:
  <i>
   "you'd better start worrying                                          about your future"
  </i>
  . If your worries                                          aren't at least as frequent as your bowel                                          movements, you're seen as irresponsible,                                          childish, aimless. That's a "responsible                                          adult" game rule.

    Gives a couple of nice tips. One that seems plausible is to "postpone" worrying. At any given time, if you start worrying about something trivial, write it down on a worry sheet, so you can mull over it later. The author says that, eventually most people forget about it.
