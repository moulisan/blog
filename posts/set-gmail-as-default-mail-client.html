            For those who are using Firefox 3 (if you dont, and want to try, go

 here
</a>
), the official gmail blog has a great how to on how to set your default email client to gmail. I think this is great for some of us, who use gmail more than any other email. I do not have my outlook or OE set up for any email service, and most times, I end up copying the email address into clipboard, and then opening up gmail and pasting into the To: address bar. I think this hack will save a lot of time.

Go ahead, and take a look. This might for you as well. [
