            This is just amazing. Read this exerpt:
<blockquote>
 A little over 30 years ago, a teenager named Jadav "Molai" Payeng began burying seeds along a barren sandbar near his birthplace in northern India's Assam region to grow a refuge for wildlife. Not long after, he decided to dedicate his life to this endeavor, so he moved to the site where he could work full-time creating a lush new forest ecosystem. Incredibly, the spot today hosts a sprawling 1,360 acre of jungle that Payeng planted single-handedly.
</blockquote>
Wow. Talk about perseverence, and a love for nature. I can imagine how happy he would have been through the 30 years to see his "forest" grow. Some of us are not even successful in keeping our tulsi healthy.
