<li>
  Loved the book.
 </li>
<li>
  If you are a wantrepreneur (person who is permanently dreaming about being an entrepreneur), this is a book you should read.
 </li>
<li>
  Talks about a dozen or so start-up stories. And the variety is amazing.
 </li>
<li>
  The book is in the form of informal interviews with the entrepreneurs.
 </li>
<li>
  Most of these are folks who broke away from tradition. Son of a government employee turning into a wildlife photographer, or the son of a business man growing brocolli and iceberg lettuce in India, or the person whose passion it was to making cheese in India.
 </li>
<li>
  Some stories are those of grit - like the Dosa Plaza story. Some are of the kismat/Junoon type. There are some stories of breaking away of monotony. There is of course, the famous story of Veta (the English training institute) starting from a thatched roof for rent.
 </li>
<li>
  The tantra tshirt story, the Haathi Chaap (recycled paper from Elephant dung) story - fascinating reads.
 </li>
<li>
  The exotic story of an economics professor in an university wanting to get into the hotel industry, where he worked 3 hours every night (after teaching the whole day) -- Oriental cuisines, which owns several mall food courts and fine dining restaurants across India.
 </li>
<li>
  Read the book in my Kindle paperwhite. Gave me the edge to skip chapters that I was not too much into (there are a couple of stories about folks who made it big in the theatre industry).
 </li>
<li>
  Overall good read. Written in a very engaging style. Lots and lots of research.
 </li>
<li>
  Kudos to the author - Rashmi Bansal.
