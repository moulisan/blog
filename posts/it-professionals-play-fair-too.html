<h1>IT professionals play fair too.</h1>
            What comes to mind, for a lot of non IT-professionals is that, they are being unfairly treated well, and that they are over paid, and that, the compensation is not commensurate with the work they do etc. However, it is not known for too many people (other than the family of the IT professional), that we guys usually (almost always) carry our work with us home too. We need to check email, and sometimes even work from home. Most times, IT professionals do not have the luxury of doing work only at work, and not carrying work home.

Coming to the fairness part of the post, today in

, there was a reader poll, asking if we should get paid overtime, for the time we spend at home, checking email. This is the current status of the poll.

Look at the option having the largest votes. I rest my case.
