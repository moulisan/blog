            <h1>US finds mineral deposits in Afghanistan</h1>
            The NewYork Times has an article which says that the US has
<strong>
 discovered
</strong>
huge amounts of mineral deposits in Afghanistan. Nice try. And we all have to believe that, only now that the US
<strong>
 found
</strong>
it. I am reminded of the Avatar movie. the US has (atleast till now) invaded and fought war only in countries, where it has had some amount of financial interests (the various middle east wars). It has always claimed that, the wars have been fought for
<strong>
 installing peace
</strong>
in these areas. And then what? Establish American companies there and reap the financial benefits. Very ironical is the fact that, the movie Avatar also had the exact same theme - precious mineral contents. I am pretty sure that the US would have found all of this using sophisticated remote sensing satellite technologies.

An excerpt:
<blockquote>
 U.S. Discovers Nearly $1 Trillion in Afghan Mineral Deposits

The United States has discovered nearly $1 trillion in
untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any
previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter
the Afghan economy and perhaps the Afghan war itself,
according to senior American government officials.

The previously unknown deposits -- including huge veins of
iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals
like lithium -- are so big and include so many minerals that
are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could
eventually be transformed into one of the most important
mining centers in the world, the United States officials
believe.
