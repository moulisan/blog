            Dear Feedly

Could you please bring back the big green check mart which used to appear just below the article list? This used to be so much better.

What was:
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/feedly1.png">
 <img alt="feedly1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2885" height="765" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/feedly1.png" width="714"/>
</a>
Once I was done flipping through the articles, I would just go 'bam' on the "Mark feed as read".

But now:
<a href="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/feedly2.jpg">
 <img alt="feedly2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2886" height="854" src="https://gcmouli.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/feedly2.jpg" width="622"/>
</a>
See how much I need to scroll to get to the teeny check mark. This happens especially bad in the Magazine view. It is slightly better in the cards view. But the check mark is still small. I want that big smacking green check mark to go 'bam' on when I am done reading my feeds.

Please feedly - in the interest of going mainstream, don't take away these small pleasures.

Yours
