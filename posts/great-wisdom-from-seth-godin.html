I read this great FastCo article about 4 Bullet points that Seth gave in a talk to Creatives on how to do Design that matters. I personally feel that, these are great points for even non-creatives. For that matter, these are great for anybody who 'produces' as part of their job. And yes, I count software lines of code as production. I count efficient management of projects as production too.

The four points are:
<ol>
 <li>
  <span style="color: #339966;">
   Do it in purpose
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="color: #339966;">
   Tell stories that resonate with those in charge
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="color: #339966;">
   Demand responsibility, and do not worry at all about authority.
  </span>
 </li>
 <li>
  <span style="color: #339966;">
   Reflect credit but embrace blame.
  </span>
 </li>
</ol>
I agree with all of these points a 100%. I have actually practiced some of these points in different points in time in my career, and they _work_.

Seth apparently ended the talk with a great quote:
<blockquote>
 <span style="color: #339966;">
  “I have no doubt the people in this room are going to succeed. The question is: Are you going to matter?”
 </span>
</blockquote>
Love the quote.
