I heard about this movie first in
<a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w">
 Merlin Mann's podcast with Dan Benjamin
</a>
(in the
<a href="http://5by5.tv">
 5x5 network)
</a>

. 
<p>It is a great fun podcast talking about tech and productivity - two things that I am super passionate about. But I digress. Merlin was talking about this movie and was comparing it to living in Florida, and how sometimes the folks are in their 'own world'. 
I noted it down and wanted to watch it some time, and I got the chance today.<p>
<p>
It is a pretty nice movie about an average guy (Luke Wilson), who is in the army. He gets chose for an experiment called "human hibernation". Unfortunately, the Army forgets about this top secret experiment, and when Luke gets out of the chamber, it is the year 2500AD. 
<p>
Things are not too dandy. The world has gotten all topsy turvy, and the average IQ has fallen abysmally, making Luke the smartest man on the planet. The world is then fully of super dumb people. Folks who believe water can be replaced with Gatorade (even for watering crops). Everything is amiss.
<p>
In all, a pretty good entertainer, and an eye opener. Comes with a nice message of getting your kids to read, to get educated, and just be overall smart.
