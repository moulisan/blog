This is what I like about the internet most. Healthy competition. Free flow of opinions and ideas. I am sure Mr. Pavlina will take this in good sport too. Steve had a nice article sometime back on
<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/10-reasons-you-should-never-get-a-job/">
 10 reasons why one should never work for someone
</a>
.

Business blog
<a href="http://www.businesspundit.com">

</a>
has a rebuttal post to it. 'Rob', the author gives his opinion on each of the 10 points that Steve makes, and dismisses them. He ofcourse, says that these are purely of his own experience. Very nicely written rebuttal. Each point that Steve makes, 'Rob' has a comeback.

For instance,
<blockquote>
 6. Having an evil bovine masterThe flip side of this is you could work for a business genius that teaches you all sorts of lessons in two or three years that it would have taken you ten years to learn on your own. Think about it - if you want to be a value investor would you rather start from scratch or work a few years under Warren Buffett?
</blockquote>
Nice.
