All my blogger posts are in here in wordpress now.

All my archived posts have been nicely categorized.

There are some things which bugged me during the transition but all in all, it was a pretty painless move. The php script did its job meticulously and diligently. There was just one time it hiccupped and just stopped and gave a 404 message. And my heart just stopped beating. But after that, I resetted the script and ran it again, and it ran to completion. There was also the issue of bad formatting on my blog spot and wordpress after the move. The issue was a wide line, in one of my posts. This pushed the right side tool bar all the way down, making the blog look horrendous. Apparently many people faced this issue, so finding the problem/solution on google was a breeze.
