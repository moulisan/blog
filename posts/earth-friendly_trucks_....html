 HFI is short for hydrogen fuel injection. This is a very cool concept. An aftermarket part, which basically injects small quantities of hydrogen along with air intake in diesel combustion engines. The deal is that hydrogen combusts faster than diesel. Hence, two nice things happen. One, there is faster combustion and you get more energy than if you just burn fuel. Two, you burn more completely, and hence lesser black smoke (which contains partially combusted hydrocarbons) is emitted. Truckers in North America are trying out this concept - which is saving them big bucks.
