Yes, you heard me right. In Guantanamo, they apparently use music to torture their prisoners. They play music really loud, for a long time, until the prisoners break down. Some of the musicians and a human rights group are all up in arms and want to talk to Obama to stop this. I bet Obama is going to have a wry smile on this face when he hears this ... and says "So ... you are saying that they are using your music as torture ??" . It will be his first test of diplomacy. Lets see if he keeps a straight face!
