<h1>Simplicity, and yet refined Sophistication</h1>
            Watched a
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lvMgMrNDlg">
 rare interview of Steve Jobs
</a>
circa 1980 yesterday. That man was a genius. He knew what he wanted 30 years ago. And I believe he accomplished what he wanted. *RESPECT*

Some key points that just blew my mind away:
<ul>
<li>
  Man builds tools to amplify his abilities.
 </li>
<li>
  A computer is a tool to help you solve a problem. But we throw a big problem betwn you and your problem-learn how to use the computer. Our goal is to simplify that problem between you and your problem as much as possible"
 </li>
<li>
  For some crazy reason in the Universe (that I dont know about), two people in Los Altos and Cupertino had a need for a computer (and built), that a million other people want. Crazy that this fits the exact same need of all these people.
 </li>
<li>
  The name "Apple computers" represented what we wanted as a culture - simplicity and yet very refined sophistication".
 </li>
<li>
  We should be talking about solutions, and not hardware or software. It is the solution that should just work - whatever it takes.
 </li>
<li>
  Comparison of Automobiles to Computers. Dump trucks, cars, buses - they have pretty much the same parts - transmissions, steering mechanisms, wheels, seats. They are all a means of transportation. What they differ on is emphasis on its function. Same way, we will build Apple computers with an emphasis that we will refine and define.
 </li>
<li>
  We have about 500 people. We will probably do between a 150 and 200 million dollars of sales. If you divide this by the number of employees, the sales $ per employee that you will get is probably a number that no one ever has heard of before. Thats because we have the most incredible collection of people on the planet.
