Trip details:
<ul>
 <li>
  Distance = 443 km (one-way)
 </li>
 <li>
  Road until Namakkal is awesome (4-6 lane National Highway). I keep referring this to as Vajpayee Road - lest we forget the great man who kicked off the Golden Quadrilateral Highway project.
 </li>
 <li>
  Speed will drop while approaching Salem though. Even though it is a bypass, several roundabouts and a lot of traffic will reduce your speed.
 </li>
 <li>
  After Namakkal, it is 2 lane highway. Road quality is pretty decent though.
 </li>
 <li>
  I was told that the last stretch to Musiri is really bad. So my brother-in-law had asked me to take the Kulithalai bridge just before reaching Musiri. The Kulithalai to Trichy road runs parallel to the Musiri Trichy road - just on the other side of the River Cauvery. The road however is decent.
 </li>
 <li>
  Once inside Trichy, there are two ways to reach Kumbakonam.
 </li>
 <li>
  First way is through Kallanai (Grand Anaicut) -&gt; Thiruvaiyaar -&gt; Kumbakonam.
 </li>
 <li>
  I took this road on my onward journey. This is typical country road. Single lane. The road quality is OK, not spectacular. There are patches of good and bad roads. I am told however to avoid this road during rainy season, since the road quality invariably deteriorates.
 </li>
 <li>
  Second way is through Tanjore -&gt; Kumbakonam.
 </li>
 <li>
  I took this road on the way back. From Trichy, take the road towards Samayapuram. You will see the road leading to Nagappitanam. This is a national highway connecting Nagappatinam-&gt;Coimbatore. Extremely good road. This road leads you to Tanjore outskirts. Take the Tanjore bypass toward Papanasam. You will hit Ammapettai, Papanasam, Swamimalai and then Kumbakonam.
 </li>
 <li>
  Tanjore to Kumbakonam is typical of all Tanjore district (tanjavoor jilla roads :)) roads. Single lane. Winding roads with trees and fields on both sides. THe road will pass through every village/town on the road. Crazy bus drivers. Watch out for unmarked speed breakers too.
 </li>
