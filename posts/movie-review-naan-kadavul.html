<h1>Movie Review: Naan Kadavul</h1>
<blockquote>
<em>
  Disclaimer: Below post has full story of the movie. I will not call it a spoiler, since it is a spoiler (you will spoil yourself) if you watch the movie. Might as well read below.

<ul>
<li>
  Movie directed by Bala. So has to be psycho movie.
 </li>
<li>
  Hero is Arya, who has portrayed perfect psycho.
 </li>
<li>
  One family gets one baby boy. Josier says some big dosham. Family should not see baby for 14 yrs.
 </li>
<li>
  Stupid father goes and drops off the baby at Kasi
 </li>
<li>
  14 yrs later. same stupid father and girl (younger sister to above said dosham baby) go to kasi in search of boy
 </li>
<li>
  Father and sister find the boy to have become an agori saint (the saints who worship dead bodies etc. Rumoured they also eat some parts of flesh.
  <strong>
   This is Arya.
  </strong>
</li>
<li>
  Movie shows agori saints in light. Saints always high on drugs and bhaang. But this nice rudram songs comes here only. Saints upside down dhyanam in komanam etc.
 </li>
<li>
  Father begs guruji of above said brother to please let him take him down south (trichy) to show to his mother.
 </li>
<li>
  Parallel track during all of above is villian who is pichaikaaran manager - runs a big gang of pichaikaaras. Very gruesome. Unable to watch for long.
 </li>
<li>
  Above said mottai villain also in trichy.
 </li>
<li>
  Arya behaves all psycho even after he comes to Trichy. Mother cries - why should she see son in above said psycho form. Might as well not see. etc etc
 </li>
<li>
  In above parallel track, one blind girl is pseudo-heroine.
 </li>
<li>
  Mottai abducts pseudo-heroine, angering Arya. Around this time, it is kinda blurry. She comes to him and asks why she should live any further with so much suffering. Then suddenly she dies, and arya brings flame from right hand and burns her right there !
 </li>
<li>
  Then Arya hunts down mottai and kills him
 </li>
<li>
<em>
<strong>
    End of story. No ending (happy or sad) - which is typical of Bala
   </strong>
