            <h1>Scott Collins quote ...</h1>
            Just prior to Firefox 1.0 arriving, Mozilla's Scott Collins, a veteran of Netscape and evangelist for the Mozilla team,
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2004/06/collins-interview.ars">
 said this to Linux.Ars
</a>
:
<blockquote>
 "I have hope that we will be a mainstream browser and that people will use Mozilla. That's the thing I learned to lust after as a programmer. It's not my ability to solve one problem, to plow this field, but the ability to build a plow that every farmer uses. The ability to make something that touches not ten people, not a hundred people, not a thousand people but a hundred million people. I want Mozilla to be there again. IE is a browser with no soul. I want it to be Mozilla because I think that people who care deserve a browser with a soul."
