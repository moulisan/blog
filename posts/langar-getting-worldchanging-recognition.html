A group of people from all over the world are at the Doors of Perception conference in India, where the theme is "Food and Juice".
<blockquote>
 It's an exploration of food systems worldwide, and the energy required to make them go.

A group went to the Langar in Bangla Saheb Gurudwara in Delhi to analyze the energy that goes in to the community service kitchen. Langar in punjabi means "Free kitchen". I have been to this place, and it is impressive. The sikhs have this volunteer duty (or 'seva' as they call it) as part of their religious observance. It is very cool to see this noticed in the world media.
