I know it is a little late, but better late than never. Vijay's movies are the best time-pass movies as far as I have seen, second only to the one-and-only-thalaivar (the boss, mottai boss). The concise review of the movie:
<ul>
 <li>
  Time pass movie.
 </li>
 <li>
  Some parts of the movie shot in Munich, Germany (ofcourse, you should not ask, just like in a thalaivar movie, where did Munich suddenly come from, just watch!)
 </li>
 <li>
  I was expecting the eppidi-eppidi--ippidi-ippidi punch dialogue to come a lot (after all the hype), but it comes for 3 seconds in a song ! Disappointing.
 </li>
 <li>
  I did not see too many punch dialogues - again disappointing.
 </li>
 <li>
  Good fight scenes.
 </li>
 <li>
  Some of the dance sequences are directed beautifully - no wonder - Prabhu Deva is the director. There is even one song, where the finale of the song has the Indian Michael Jackson shaking a leg with Vijay.
 </li>
 <li>
  No crying scenes (Vijay is not good in senti scenes and the good part is, the directors realize this and do not give him any such scenes.)
 </li>
 <li>
  Some unbelievble scenes - but then they have to be there in a Vijay movie - like Prakash Raj burying him alive, and a sandstorm blowing all the sand away, and he rising up from the grave. Oh! Did I mention he was also shot at twice!
 </li>
 <li>
  Nayanthara does the usual come-and-look-pretty show and goes. Not bad. Nothing wrong to say about that. (Read: no spectacular acting)
 </li>
 <li>
  Overall good comedy scenes by Vadivelu.
 </li>
 <li>
  Some good intricate plotting situations by various international Dons (one of whom is Prakash Raj). Prakash Raj does a standard factory-product villian - nothing new. Good thing is - he has toned down his ridiculous ... uhaahaahaaaa laugh and the chellam dialogue. Thank God. It was getting so trite.
 </li>
 <li>
  Some super flaky scenes like, when Vijay's dad is accused of being a traitor, and gets killed, his mother gets 'desa drogi manaivi' (traitor wife) tattooed on her forehead.
 </li>
 <li>
  Two things however baffled me.
  <ul>
   <li>
    When the whole world is saying that Blu-Ray is dead, the movie shows the villians trade secrets all stored in a Blu-Ray disc. Haha. Why ? Why ? Maybe because it 'sounds' fancy.
   </li>
   <li>
    Why the name Villu ? His name is not villu (his name is Pugazh). He does not have any fancy electronic villu (nor the bamboo one). Why ? Why?
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

  Overall rating : Typical timepass Vijay Movie. Watchable once.
