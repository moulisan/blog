<h1>Information Week looks at Software companies in India</h1>
            A wonderful article in Information week, where a reporter spends a week down in India, touring the software giants and seeing how much of opportunities abound and how much more of challenges and hurdles exist.

The closing paragraph:
<blockquote>
 Microland showed us a 14-page job description for a staff position, filled with details about the technical capabilities required. The attention to detail, technical and management skills, and professionalism demonstrated by these organizations--and their talk of 30% savings--had a calming effect on my IT colleagues listening to their pitches. There are still questions to be answered through reference checks and pilot programs, but I'd say India's outsourcers have a good chance of winning another customer.
