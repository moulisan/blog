Just finished reading a long article on the Wall Street Journal, on the plight of the iconic American car maker - GM. On Monday, June 1, 2009, GM filed for bankruptcy. For a carmaker, which had more than 50% of the market share in the United States, it is indeed a starting end. We now need to see what happens. America was known for its cars - hey, Ford invented the first motor car!. And it is shocking to see the economic downturn pull down the very symbol of its economy. All because of some suits in the investment community, who became a little too greedy, and started doing unethical, impractical, and yet stupid things. It brought the real estate market crashing down. Now it is the auto industry. What is next ?
<strong>
 How to read WSJ articles free (without subscription):
</strong>
What WSJ has done for the sake of google to index all of its content, proves very benefical to people like me, who read WSJ articles only on a semi-regular basis. Go to online.wsj.com. All the articles which are subscriber only content, have a key symbol next to it. (For example: "A Saga of Decline and Denial" - this is the article that I mention above, that I just finished reading). Copy-paste the title of the article (in this example - "A Saga of Decline and Denial" into google). And click the first link, and there you have it - the article in full glory. Thanks Openculture for this nugget of information (
