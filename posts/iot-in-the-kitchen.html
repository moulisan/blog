            This idea just struck me today evening. This is in close heels to the IoT usage with the

<strong>
 Problem to be solved:
</strong>
<p>
Get an accurate state of groceries that is stocked in the kitchen and potentially order them (online?). This is a very common task that is done on a fairly regular basis in most households (typically on the day when 'monthly shopping' is done,
<strong>
 Initial setup/infrastructure:
</strong>
<ul>
 <li>
  All grocery items to be stocked in identical pre-calibrated clear jars.
 </li>
 <li>
  Item stored in the jar is bar-coded.
 </li>
 <li>
  Threshold for ordering is to be set initially - by a sticker or using marker pens.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
 UX:
</strong>
<ul>
 <li>
  User invokes a smart phone app.
 </li>
 <li>
  Snaps a picture of the shelf with the stacked clear containers.
 </li>
 <li>
  App automatically figures out the jars with groceries lesser than the threshold set by the user.
 </li>
 <li>
  The details of what is stored in the jar is obtained from the bar code.
 </li>
 <li>
  User either adds the list of items to buy to his to-do list (Google keep? Wunderlist?) - or - directly adds it to his grocery list on the Bigbasket app.
 </li>
</ul>
Bigbasket? Zopnow? Anybody listening?
