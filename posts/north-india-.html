            This may seem a rant to some ... for the rest, please be informed, that, this is indeed a rant.

Conversation in the ITPL shopping area (tech park mall):

 &gt;   Hi ... You look familiar.
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 &gt; Hmm. I dont recall seeing you (noticing the TCS badge)
 <strong>
  Random Person
 </strong>
 &gt; [Extends hand] Im Rajesh, from TCS.
 <strong>
  Me&gt;
 </strong>
 [Extending hand as well] Mouli from {insert company name here}
 <strong>
  Random Person
 </strong>
 &gt; Ah, ok [Pretty apparent that he did not recognize the company name]
 <strong>
  Random Person
 </strong>
 &gt; Where are you from originally ? [Apparent that he has mistakenly assumed that I am a Shukla/Gupta/Singh/Dey/... from  my fair complexion]
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 &gt; Madras
 <strong>
  Random Person
 </strong>
 &gt; [Pretty taken aback]. Oh ! [a brief couple of seconds pause] I am from North India.
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 [in my head]&gt; Uh. Where is that ? Is that a separate country (like North Korea/South Korea). I thought there was only
 <strong>
  ONE INDIA
 </strong>
 . Where did that come from? Ofcourse I was miffed. Very pis**ed off indeed.
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 [aloud]&gt; I was in {stressing} North India too, you know. Noida, for about 5 years.
 <strong>
  Random Person
 </strong>
 &gt; Really. [Apparent from his expression, that he is shocked that someone from
 <strong>
  South India
 </strong>
 (yeah like in the separate country we are), could survive in Noida that long.
 <strong>
  Me
 </strong>
 &gt; Nice meeting you. Gotta go. [giving him a quizzical look and thinking, "
 <em>
  tsk tsk .. when will these guys grow up?
 </em>
 "]
</blockquote>
I have to say something though -- it is not everyone who is like this. I have several friends from Delhi, and not all of them are like this. I know several who treat the whole country as their own, and freely migrate to different parts of the country, and also
<strong>
 adapt to the local customs/society etc.
</strong>
Maybe it is just me -- but I guess, I would not have gotten so irritated, if he had said, "Im from Delhi". What is up with the 'North India' thing ; and the shocking expressions. Grow up guys.
