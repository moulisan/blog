            I have been thinking about this for a while. And yes, this is one of my dream product posts - there might be hints of technology possibility inside, but no means an algorithm. I will spell out a couple of use cases first.
<strong>
 Use case1:
</strong>
I hail an uber from home. The pickup location is picked up either through physical GPS on the device or by wifi triangulation. Now that is passed to Uber for pickup. Now, let us say, I take my phone, and walk to the end of my road, to the main road. I want to be picked up from there, because there is too much traffic inside my side road. Uber cannot be notified of that. Can uber triangulate to my phone and locate me?
<strong>
 Use case2:
</strong>
I call customer support for fixing my washing machine. Ideally, there should be one final question from the customer support representative - "Can I send the technician to the place where this phone is?" The system should figure out the address and send the technician.

There are several more use cases where this could help. There are obviously privacy concerns here, but there must be someway to fix that problem. I have been facing this issue so many times in recent times, giving directions to people, when they should just be able to locate me.
