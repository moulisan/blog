Who said imported technology cannot be band-aided? The flashy volvo buses are very popular in Bangalore. I see it full all the time. Looks like the fancy rear-view mirror has had some damage in this bus (the traffic in Bangalore is ridiculous). If the BMTC went to Volvo service center to repair it, they would probably have been charged a huge amount. Instead the fix seen in this picture probably cost a few rupees - bandaged with a cycle tyre tube. Ingenuity at its best.
